I told my GF to come with us and I even told her I would invite her, but she told me that she didn't feel comfortable when people invite her and never confirmed whether she'd come with us or not. Until my friends showed up and we were able to locate everybody, it became 19:40. We also hadn't previously decided on a place to go and have dinner/beers. There were several places in our area and we walked around trying to find an attractive place to get settled. At around 20:30, she called me and asked me where I was and reminded me that we agreed to meet. I apologised to her for not writing to her but I told her that I didn't because we were walking around and that I cannot message her while walking, and that I would send her our location as soon as we found a place. She replied with, \"No! I scheduled to meet with YOU, and only YOU. So you are not coming?\" I repeated the part about sending her my location as soon as we had one. She said, \"No. I am not meeting your stupid friends and in my opinion, go to hell!\" \n\nMy friends and I took a group photo and I sent it to her. I guess that was to make her jealous that she cannot hold me back from meeting my friends, as she had done in the past. She blocked me on WhatsApp. GF has since unblocked me but I haven't spoken to her since. It's been a week with no contact. This morning, her sister wrote to me, \"What happened? You're not coming by anymore\". The first thing I thought when I read that was why do I have to go to her? Can she not come to my place? She rarely comes to my place because she is no longer eligible for a young transport pass in our city. However, I am. GF also doesn't work and prefers not to pay 3€ for the ride to my place. I also thought about all of our previous fights/arguments. All of them have the same structure: \n\nGF tells me to meet -> I say I don't know but maybe -> GF misunderstands it as a yes -> GF asks, quite rudely, \"so are you coming?\" -> I give her a LEGITIMATE reason not to come (related either to my studies or housework, sometimes a mandatory flight from flight school) -> GF blaming me for \"not organising my time well\" and for \"being an irresponsible egoist\" -> me trying to change the plan to accommodate both my obligations as well as her wishes -> GF not having it -> **me** having to **apologise** to **her** thousands of times just to acknowledge me again. \n\nI am not interested in being in a relationship with a girl who is practically as religious as a nun (as mentioned in my previous post) who will manipulate me like this. All these fights and her actions to make me feel bad are part of a greater psychological and emotional manipulation. \n\nMy friends tell me that I shouldn't talk to her, and that if **she** wants to talk to **me**, she should do it first. My parents and brother tell me that it's been a week with no contact and I should initiate the conversation with her and consider whether this relationship is good for me or not. Some Reddit users commented on how we may no longer be compatible and that we should break up. **I am completely torn apart and have no idea what to do next, and how to make things clear between us.** I would also like to add that I do have feelings for her and that I consider them, but it's hard for me to predict how exactly my actions might affect her. I know best how they affect me. Please help me moving forward.\n\nTL;DR - GF and I had a fight that was the straw that broke the camel's back, I have no idea how to move forward.","author_fullname":"t2_3fuwmvod","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"UPDATE (Somewhat) to my Previous Post on my Girlfriend","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationships","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"new","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_fbteee","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":0,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"[new]","can_mod_post":false,"score":0,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1583094568,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.relationships","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A while back, I made a post about my girlfriend who is very religious and made me feel like an enabler.

All of them have the same structure: </p>\n\n<p>GF tells me to meet -&gt; I say I don&#39;t know but maybe -&gt; GF misunderstands it as a yes -&gt; GF asks, quite rudely, &quot;so are you coming?&quot; -&gt; I give her a LEGITIMATE reason not to come (related either to my studies or housework, sometimes a mandatory flight from flight school) -&gt; GF blaming me for &quot;not organising my time well&quot; and for &quot;being an irresponsible egoist&quot; -&gt; me trying to change the plan to accommodate both my obligations as well as her wishes -&gt; GF not having it -&gt; <strong>me</strong> having to <strong>apologise</strong> to <strong>her</strong> thousands of times just to acknowledge me again. </p>\n\n<p>I am not interested in being in a relationship with a girl who is practically as religious as a nun (as mentioned in my previous post) who will manipulate me like this. All these fights and her actions to make me feel bad are part of a greater psychological and emotional manipulation. </p>\n\n<p>My friends tell me that I shouldn&#39;t talk to her, and that if <strong>she</strong> wants to talk to <strong>me</strong>, she should do it first. My parents and brother tell me that it&#39;s been a week with no contact and I should initiate the conversation with her and consider whether this relationship is good for me or not. Some Reddit users commented on how we may no longer be compatible and that we should break up. <strong>I am completely torn apart and have no idea what to do next, and how to make things clear between us.</strong> I would also like to add that I do have feelings for her and that I consider them, but it&#39;s hard for me to predict how exactly my actions might affect her. I know best how they affect me. Please help me moving forward.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR - GF and I had a fight that was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back, I have no idea how to move forward.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fbteee","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"sagbon98","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":15,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fbteee/update_somewhat_to_my_previous_post_on_my/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fbteee/update_somewhat_to_my_previous_post_on_my/","subreddit_subscribers":2795065,"created_utc":1583065768,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"I’m (F22) a caring person and genuinely want the best for anyone that comes in and out of my life.

First of all I want to make it clear that I really love my BF and he loves me, we’ve been together for 7 years (5 years living together), and our relationship is stable, we can trust each other, never one of us did something hurtful or damaging to our relationship or anything like that. \n\n\nThe thing is; he is the only man I’ve ever been with, he was my first real boyfriend, and lately (like since the last year) I’ve been having fantasies very often about being with other men, I have found myself like staring at guys that I feel attracted to thinking about doing sex stuff to them. I don’t mean I stare like a creep, but I’m like really seeing the guys in my surroundings, I used not to pay attention to men walking next to me or near me in general but I am now.\n\n\nIn my single years I never had the opportunity to go out with friends maybe to a bar and flirt with random guys, I grew up in a very conservative family so I was only able to live freely like a normal adult woman when I started living with my boyfriend. From time to time I feel I bit sad I couldn’t go through those experiences.\n\n\nAnyways, sometimes when I catch guys looking at me (I know I’m good looking) if I find them hot I respond with a slight smile and a flirtatious look, if we start talking ABOUT RANDOM STUFF and I’m feeling a bit hot I subtly play with my hair, give them a smile and stare at their eyes and lips attentively while they’re talking to me, then, I find a reason to casually focus my attention to something else and that’s it, I leave with a polite goodbye. I think of it like an innocent game because of course I don’t plan to act on it, my relationship is monogamous, I don’t hide the fact that I have a boyfriend to anyone.\n\n\nBut guys, lately it’s like I can’t stop finding guys attractive somewhere I go, coworkers, people at the same park I take my dog for walks. I like playing this innocent game as I said above, so for example I’ve flirted with my gym trainer (NOT a personal trainer), he started it though, he without a reason played with my hair (ponytail) for a sec and almost always greeted me when I arrived to the gym (it wasn’t necessary as I already had my routine planned and didn’t need help) somehow he always said hi, he was the only trainer to call me for a short name (diminutive name), sometimes he walked near where I was in some machine doing an exercise and he touched my ankle and smiled. I’ve casually mentioned in chats with him that I have a boyfriend, I didn’t want to give him the wrong idea. This guy is so freaking hot, veeeery hot, I couldn’t not let myself admire his face and body. The most “risky flirt” with this guy was staring at his eyes while he spoke to me and slowly look at his lips and back at his eyes, I think he got some of this vibe by the look on his face but as I said it was just that, besides it lasted a few minutes. I remember I felt so turned on at that moment by the sexual tension that I even got a little wet, I wanted to fuck him but nothing happened and it’s okay. I’ve been very busy with work lately so I paused the gym and I haven’t seen him in a while...I kinda miss him.\n\n\nWhat I’m trying to say is that I feel like everything turns me on now, I’m choosing erotic literature and comics, have been watching considerably more porn than before, fantasizing with men I know and trying to look for similar people in porn. I think I’ve always been very vanilla but now I fantasize about devil’s threesomes, about men I now, about characters, actors... with being maybe slapped and having my hair pulled, having a man’s hand pressing my neck (I don’t know if I would like erotic asphyxiation but I fantasize about it). Guys, I have got wet multiple times just for watching a hot guy in a cafeteria -or public place- and thinking about this stuff.\n\n\nAnd the weird thing is: I don’t feel this extreme arousal when I get turned on by my boyfriend, or when I think about having sex with him. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy sex with him, he isn’t great at kissing which I fantasize about a lot too but he’s great in bed and can even pleasure me with multiple orgasms...he has stated that he couldn’t believe I was a virgin when we started dating because everything I did was incredibly good like an experienced person would be, but I wonder how it would be with somebody else? I don’t know, I think my BF and I can try some things but what I feel like I need is another man. \n\n\n\nWhat do you guys think about this and what advice would you give me?. Hope you have a nice day, thanks for reading.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I have been in a monogamous relationship for 7 years, have a good sexual life with my BF, but now I can’t stop thinking about other men to the point off getting wet just for looking at hot men in public places and fantasizing about them.

I’m also pretty sad right now so please be patient with me as this might get long \n\nI (24F) and my boyfriend (25M) have been dating for around 10 months. We started out so strong but also as long distance. We really tried to make time for each other to see in person, have FaceTime dates, text when we can but also know we won’t be able to talk 24/7. We would see each other maybe 1-2 a month but sometimes it would go a little longer than a month and that was okay. Recently, going back to mid to late November, we have been having some trouble. Problems with his ex popped up, his sexual past got in the way (has been with a lot more women than I have been with men), and me just feeling like he didn’t want to spend alone time with me because we would always hang out together in a group unless we were at his apartment getting ready to go out and or go to sleep.

I definitely wear my heart on my sleeve and that’s a flaw of mine.\n\nEarly in February, we had a weekend planned for valentines early since we wouldn’t get to see each other for like a month after that. I texted him saying I was excited to see him but he didn’t say it back and instead asked me how I was feeling because I had the flu that whole week. It made me overthink and I got upset because with us being long distance, those texts matter to me. He said “Do I really have to tell you how I feel?” And I said absolutely because I can’t read his mind. I made a petty comment saying I’m upset and that I didn’t want to talk to him and when he called me I just denied it. When he got to the Air B&B he didn’t bring his bags in with him. My heart sunk instantly. We had a long discussion of what we want in a relationship and we both agreed that we need to be better at working as a team than against each other. He ended up staying at his parents house that night but we connected in the morning for the rest of the activities planned and he said he really enjoyed it and it showed him how much he loved spending time with me.\n\nOkay so now flash forward to yesterday. I just shot him a text saying I feel like he has pushed our relationship to the side because work has consumed him and he agreed. We FaceTimed for about 2 hours and he asked what I needed out of this relationship and I told him to communicate when he is stressed at work because I’ll never know and to express his feelings of when he’s excited to see me because again, we are long distance and that’s important to me. He said he doesn’t believe that he has to say he’s happy to see me or that he misses me to feel it and that he doesn’t know if he’s willing/able to be the man I need him to be. He said it’s not my fault because I deserve that but he doesn’t know if he can do that for me. He ultimately decided he needs space and he will text me with what he decides is the right decision aka being together or not. I told him I don’t believe in space because nothing good ever comes from it. But he didn’t care and he said he was sorry and he needed space.\n\nI know this all just happened yesterday but I have lost my appetite, I didn’t sleep last night, and I can’t stop crying. I have a horrible feeling of what is going to happen. I truly do love him with my whole heart and I cannot picture my life without him.

(It's a fellowship where you must pay - 1 year liberal arts course).  She had the expectation of a placement (In India the University the  expected to help you get a job). It's the first time she has every paid  any significant amount for education. And she really wants a good ROI.\n\nIt's March, and she hasn't gotten a job or even gotten through any placement round.  \nShe's dejected and is in many ways unleashing her fury upon me.\n\nIf  I call her after she tells me she was rejected, but don't call enough  times - she'll be disappointed and furious and says no-one cares about  her. If I tell her, I can't talk more at night because I'm sleepy and I  have work the next day - she gets furious at my priorities. She'll say I  don't support her, or give her time - but I literally stop working so  that I can text her for hours on end only to have her chewing off my  head. I have a few projects going on, and I'm giving as much time as  possible to her - I understand she's going through a lot, the job  application process is horrible, and companies here are unprofessional  and altogether pathetic in so many ways (Indian society is terrible for  so many reasons and for so many causes (fuck Central Turks and British).  I'm trying to be supportive. At first I tried pragmatic advice - do X,  do Y. She agrees but never follows through unless I spoon feed it to  her. It's basic advice - learn how to code, practice your eloquence,  practice your writing - basically become more skilled. But I feel like  it was making her more insecure, so now I just listen and say its  difficult. I'm there, and other platitudes and aphorisms. But she's  saying, I'm not helping, and continues to chew me out for the most minor  things. For example, I stopped texting her for a few minutes to make  instant noodles - I got chewed out for telling her I wasn't busy when I  was busy making noodles.\n\nThe  biggest issue is her expectations. She won't voice what she wants me to  do, but when I don't do what she wants she'll get very angry. Then when  she finally voices it, and I do it - she'll reject it because I only did  it because she voiced it. I should have done it on my own. I try to  explain I'm not a mind-reader, but she says I lack emotional  intelligence, and I'm individualistic/selfish (which she chalks to being  American). For example, she would take a metro ride to get to my side  of town, and we would book a hotel together (I stay with my parents for a  plethora of reasons). But then she got mad at me for not picking her up  deep in town, I then offered to pick her up, but she said I should have  figured it out for myself and then refused my ride. She then continued  to lament my inability to think about her from her perspective. I  thought she was comfortable with the situation and would voice her  concerns if they arose, but apparently you only voice concerns when its  too late.\n\nI've made mistakes too.  On one of my birthdays, I somewhat rejected a gift she made for me. It  was a glow in the dark jar, but it didn't work, was gross, slimey and  repugnant. I said I was grateful for the effort and told her such, but  she's furious I didn't keep it. In retaliation she rejected my gift a  remote controlled car that I specially 3d printed and assembled for her.  Additionally, I've had a vivid history with multiple relationships, and  for some stupid reason in the beginning of the two years - I told her  all of it. I also stupidly made comparisons when she requested it, and  the comparisons were altogether too honest. I told her she was better  than past relationships in X way, and worse in Y way. She has only  focused on the Y ways. All these things happened at the beginning of the  relationship, but she won't forget and won't forgive. It's like every  fight is about these two things, and how dare I say them.\n\nMore about her:  \nShe  lacks nuance. I think she splits pretty heavily, everything is black  and white to her. I can't even bring up hypothetical because she can't  process them. She can't take criticism - no matter how constructive.  I've tried to help her - but I literally can't because any comment will  be construed as a personal attack. She comes from a matrilineal line  (It's fascinating), and once had very high self-esteem and confidence  (it was sexy). But the repeated rejections have crushed her confidence -  I think her splitting which at one point made her dominant, now makes  her hate herself for being a failure.\n\nShe  is also very free in terms of time. The course she is taking is rather  pathetic (in my mind). I mean it has a good name in the country, but the  liberals arts I took (top in US) was leagues above this. I was working  my ass off, but she has two courses for two weeks which assign barely  any coursework/reading/projects. The one course I thought had merit  (statistical analysis {I'm a data geek}) she pushed onto me - and I  walked her through/even did all of her coursework.\n\nIntellectually,  we are on two different planes. I don't mind - because she will listen  to me rant about whatever topic and I'm fairly didactic. From the stock  market to the finer points of Kannada philosophy - I have given her  foundational knowledge about various facets of life she just did not  understand earlier (Although she has expressed to me she dislikes  philosophy as being too theoretical (a valid concern as Aurangzeb  described so vividly in a letter to his teacher)). I'm not certain if  she still does because she isn't all that responsive in conversation,  but I think it's just the frustration of a lack of job is eating her up  inside. Conversations are mostly dominated by me, but not for lack of  trying. It's just, since I read/work/do so much, I just have many/many  things to discuss. It's also little observations I note - little things  of society/culture you abstract with observations and reflection - it's  all very intellectual. If she does converse it's usually about people - I  don't mind gossip - in fact I love gossip about people I don't know  (usually so I can abstract it into lessons about people). But she  realizes I crave more intellectual discussion, and I believe feels  inadequate that she cannot deliver.\n\nWe  just had a fight yesterday. She acknowledges the discomfort she is  causing me, and says she cannot fathom why I am sticking around. She  tells me that if she was in my socks she would have left. I tell her,  that pain and joy are intertwined - the sadness of today is the joy I  will feel tomorrow - and I am certain that once she gets a job her  neurosis will level off and return to pre-rejection levels.\n\nShe  now wants a break of one week. Am I crazy for trying to weather this  storm? Are we too fundamentally different.

(It&#39;s a fellowship where you must pay - 1 year liberal arts course).  She had the expectation of a placement (In India the University the  expected to help you get a job). It&#39;s the first time she has every paid  any significant amount for education. And she really wants a good ROI.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s March, and she hasn&#39;t gotten a job or even gotten through any placement round.<br/>\nShe&#39;s dejected and is in many ways unleashing her fury upon me.</p>\n\n<p>If  I call her after she tells me she was rejected, but don&#39;t call enough  times - she&#39;ll be disappointed and furious and says no-one cares about  her. If I tell her, I can&#39;t talk more at night because I&#39;m sleepy and I  have work the next day - she gets furious at my priorities. She&#39;ll say I  don&#39;t support her, or give her time - but I literally stop working so  that I can text her for hours on end only to have her chewing off my  head. I have a few projects going on, and I&#39;m giving as much time as  possible to her - I understand she&#39;s going through a lot, the job  application process is horrible, and companies here are unprofessional  and altogether pathetic in so many ways (Indian society is terrible for  so many reasons and for so many causes (fuck Central Turks and British).  I&#39;m trying to be supportive. At first I tried pragmatic advice - do X,  do Y. She agrees but never follows through unless I spoon feed it to  her. It&#39;s basic advice - learn how to code, practice your eloquence,  practice your writing - basically become more skilled. But I feel like  it was making her more insecure, so now I just listen and say its  difficult. I&#39;m there, and other platitudes and aphorisms. But she&#39;s  saying, I&#39;m not helping, and continues to chew me out for the most minor  things. For example, I stopped texting her for a few minutes to make  instant noodles - I got chewed out for telling her I wasn&#39;t busy when I  was busy making noodles.</p>\n\n<p>The  biggest issue is her expectations. She won&#39;t voice what she wants me to  do, but when I don&#39;t do what she wants she&#39;ll get very angry. Then when  she finally voices it, and I do it - she&#39;ll reject it because I only did  it because she voiced it. I should have done it on my own. I try to  explain I&#39;m not a mind-reader, but she says I lack emotional  intelligence, and I&#39;m individualistic/selfish (which she chalks to being  American). For example, she would take a metro ride to get to my side  of town, and we would book a hotel together (I stay with my parents for a  plethora of reasons). But then she got mad at me for not picking her up  deep in town, I then offered to pick her up, but she said I should have  figured it out for myself and then refused my ride. She then continued  to lament my inability to think about her from her perspective. I  thought she was comfortable with the situation and would voice her  concerns if they arose, but apparently you only voice concerns when its  too late.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve made mistakes too.  On one of my birthdays, I somewhat rejected a gift she made for me. It  was a glow in the dark jar, but it didn&#39;t work, was gross, slimey and  repugnant. I said I was grateful for the effort and told her such, but  she&#39;s furious I didn&#39;t keep it. In retaliation she rejected my gift a  remote controlled car that I specially 3d printed and assembled for her.  Additionally, I&#39;ve had a vivid history with multiple relationships, and  for some stupid reason in the beginning of the two years - I told her  all of it. I also stupidly made comparisons when she requested it, and  the comparisons were altogether too honest. I told her she was better  than past relationships in X way, and worse in Y way. She has only  focused on the Y ways. All these things happened at the beginning of the  relationship, but she won&#39;t forget and won&#39;t forgive. It&#39;s like every  fight is about these two things, and how dare I say them.</p>\n\n<p>More about her:<br/>\nShe  lacks nuance. I think she splits pretty heavily, everything is black  and white to her. I can&#39;t even bring up hypothetical because she can&#39;t  process them. She can&#39;t take criticism - no matter how constructive.  I&#39;ve tried to help her - but I literally can&#39;t because any comment will  be construed as a personal attack. She comes from a matrilineal line  (It&#39;s fascinating), and once had very high self-esteem and confidence  (it was sexy). But the repeated rejections have crushed her confidence -  I think her splitting which at one point made her dominant, now makes  her hate herself for being a failure.</p>\n\n<p>She  is also very free in terms of time. The course she is taking is rather  pathetic (in my mind). I mean it has a good name in the country, but the  liberals arts I took (top in US) was leagues above this. I was working  my ass off, but she has two courses for two weeks which assign barely  any coursework/reading/projects. The one course I thought had merit  (statistical analysis {I&#39;m a data geek}) she pushed onto me - and I  walked her through/even did all of her coursework.</p>\n\n<p>Intellectually,  we are on two different planes. I don&#39;t mind - because she will listen  to me rant about whatever topic and I&#39;m fairly didactic. From the stock  market to the finer points of Kannada philosophy - I have given her  foundational knowledge about various facets of life she just did not  understand earlier (Although she has expressed to me she dislikes  philosophy as being too theoretical (a valid concern as Aurangzeb  described so vividly in a letter to his teacher)). I&#39;m not certain if  she still does because she isn&#39;t all that responsive in conversation,  but I think it&#39;s just the frustration of a lack of job is eating her up  inside. Conversations are mostly dominated by me, but not for lack of  trying. It&#39;s just, since I read/work/do so much, I just have many/many  things to discuss. It&#39;s also little observations I note - little things  of society/culture you abstract with observations and reflection - it&#39;s  all very intellectual. If she does converse it&#39;s usually about people - I  don&#39;t mind gossip - in fact I love gossip about people I don&#39;t know  (usually so I can abstract it into lessons about people). But she  realizes I crave more intellectual discussion, and I believe feels  inadequate that she cannot deliver.</p>\n\n<p>We  just had a fight yesterday. She acknowledges the discomfort she is  causing me, and says she cannot fathom why I am sticking around. She  tells me that if she was in my socks she would have left. I tell her,  that pain and joy are intertwined - the sadness of today is the joy I  will feel tomorrow - and I am certain that once she gets a job her  neurosis will level off and return to pre-rejection levels.</p>\n\n<p>She  now wants a break of one week. Am I crazy for trying to weather this  storm? Are we too fundamentally different. Is this relationship a bad  investment that at the first sign of a economic downturn it starts  crumbling and exposing itself for the Non-Performing Asset it is?</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR! Girlfriend is unleashing her frustration at me due to failure to find job. Is this a temporary thing or does it expose deeper issues?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fbpgtv","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"dhruvg001","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":4,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fbpgtv/25m_with_25f_of_2_years_compatibility_issues/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fbpgtv/25m_with_25f_of_2_years_compatibility_issues/","subreddit_subscribers":2795065,"created_utc":1583040015,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"My girlfriend of 4 months saw I'd looked up the name of a girl on the internet when we were looking at stuff on my phone.

I know that I'm in the wrong and what I did was fucked up. With that said, here's the background.\n\nI met my now husband, I'll call him AJ here, when we worked together when I was 18. He was recently divorced (amicably, there wasn't any animosity between the two of them), and we hit it off pretty well as friends, bonded over shared childhood trauma. Over time there was flirting, we made out a little here and there but it never went further. Every time it came close, and yes I did instigate that most times, I would get worried about our age difference, or ruining or friendship, or I'd just meet someone. Things happen, you know? I knew it hurt him, but i thought it would hurt him less in the long run if that makes sense.\n\nAnd then I got pregnant. The guy I was seeing accused me of cheating (I wasn't), threatened to beat me if i didn't abort, and then cut all contact. I turned to the only person I could, AJ. Now, I'm Catholic, my family is heavily Catholic, so abortion is not an option and having a baby unmarried is a quick way to get disowned. I could give a damn what my dad and brother think but my mom is my absolute rock, my best friend, she literally kept me alive when I was close to ending everything. I was so scared of losing her over this that I asked, and then begged, AJ to help me. To marry me, make it legitimate.\n\nHe was pissed, and rightfully so. But he calmed down after a day or two and we talked it out, made a plan. Long story short, we lied to my parents about our relationship and why we were getting married so quickly. He charmed them so well they didn't ask many questions, and we were married in a month. I'm sure they did the math on the pregnancy, but politely haven't said anything.\n\nIn public, or with friends and family, he is just perfect. Loving, sweet, thoughtful, attentive. With our daughter, he is the best father possible. He really engages with her and loves her and shows it every day. But when we're alone, and she's in bed, he completely shuts off. Barely speaks to me other than to discuss household stuff, spends most of his time either in the garage or in his room.\n\nHis room, because we sleep in separate rooms. Always have. The only time we've slept in the same bed is when we visited my mom and stayed in her guest room. The times I've tried to get in bed with him he's gotten up and gone to another room. We've still never had sex. And no, I'm as sure as I can be that there's no adultery happening. \n\nI love him. I've loved him for so long, and i want to fix our relationship, want us to be close like we were before. I've tried talking to him, I've tried being affectionate, being sexy, writing notes, nothing has gotten anywhere. I just want to fix this and I don't know what to do.\n\nTL;DR: heavily flirted with my best guy friend for years, got pregnant and abandoned by someone else, begged him to marry me so my family wouldn't abandon me, now we're practically strangers and I want to fix it.","author_fullname":"t2_5vcobm46","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"I (23f) think I ruined my relationship with my husband (29m) and I don't know what to do.","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationships","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"m-vt relationships","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_fev2kl","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":0,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Relationships","can_mod_post":false,"score":0,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1583616234,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.relationships","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So right off the start, i know that this is my fault.

He was recently divorced (amicably, there wasn&#39;t any animosity between the two of them), and we hit it off pretty well as friends, bonded over shared childhood trauma. Over time there was flirting, we made out a little here and there but it never went further. Every time it came close, and yes I did instigate that most times, I would get worried about our age difference, or ruining or friendship, or I&#39;d just meet someone. Things happen, you know? I knew it hurt him, but i thought it would hurt him less in the long run if that makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>And then I got pregnant. The guy I was seeing accused me of cheating (I wasn&#39;t), threatened to beat me if i didn&#39;t abort, and then cut all contact. I turned to the only person I could, AJ. Now, I&#39;m Catholic, my family is heavily Catholic, so abortion is not an option and having a baby unmarried is a quick way to get disowned. I could give a damn what my dad and brother think but my mom is my absolute rock, my best friend, she literally kept me alive when I was close to ending everything. I was so scared of losing her over this that I asked, and then begged, AJ to help me. To marry me, make it legitimate.</p>\n\n<p>He was pissed, and rightfully so. But he calmed down after a day or two and we talked it out, made a plan. Long story short, we lied to my parents about our relationship and why we were getting married so quickly. He charmed them so well they didn&#39;t ask many questions, and we were married in a month. I&#39;m sure they did the math on the pregnancy, but politely haven&#39;t said anything.</p>\n\n<p>In public, or with friends and family, he is just perfect. Loving, sweet, thoughtful, attentive. With our daughter, he is the best father possible. He really engages with her and loves her and shows it every day. But when we&#39;re alone, and she&#39;s in bed, he completely shuts off. Barely speaks to me other than to discuss household stuff, spends most of his time either in the garage or in his room.</p>\n\n<p>His room, because we sleep in separate rooms. Always have. The only time we&#39;ve slept in the same bed is when we visited my mom and stayed in her guest room. The times I&#39;ve tried to get in bed with him he&#39;s gotten up and gone to another room. We&#39;ve still never had sex. And no, I&#39;m as sure as I can be that there&#39;s no adultery happening. </p>\n\n<p>I love him. I&#39;ve loved him for so long, and i want to fix our relationship, want us to be close like we were before. I&#39;ve tried talking to him, I&#39;ve tried being affectionate, being sexy, writing notes, nothing has gotten anywhere. I just want to fix this and I don&#39;t know what to do.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: heavily flirted with my best guy friend for years, got pregnant and abandoned by someone else, begged him to marry me so my family wouldn&#39;t abandon me, now we&#39;re practically strangers and I want to fix it.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"c8ef68fc-cb00-11e2-8393-12313d262949","can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fev2kl","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"BWTA3221","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":26,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fev2kl/i_23f_think_i_ruined_my_relationship_with_my/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fev2kl/i_23f_think_i_ruined_my_relationship_with_my/","subreddit_subscribers":2795065,"created_utc":1583587434,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"So I (19F) recently broke up with my boyfriend (20M) of ten months because I found out he was using Tinder during our relationship.

On the third date, we both mentioned we weren’t seeing other people. \n\nThe fourth time, last night, he invited me to watch his hockey game, joined by two of his brothers (30/m and 25/m). \n\nI knew his brothers were coming, and I was really unsure how he’d be acting in front of them. To spare myself of possible hurt, I told myself ahead of time that he would treat me as a buddy (“friends” with benefits) in front of them. \n\nI got there ahead of time and noticed a guy who resembled him was looking at me in a certain, intentional way with a slight smile. (I found out later that was his younger brother, & he had told him “someone” would be coming to the hockey game). \n\nLater, the guy showed up with his older brother. He walked up to me and gave me a kiss. After the game, his brothers, he and I were all just hanging out at the hockey rink. Throughout the entire time, he was showing me tons of physical affection both in a sweet and naughty way in front of his brothers and also other hockey teammates passing by — kisses, putting hand around my shoulder, back rubs, hand on waist, squeezing ass, neck massage, a subtle boob squeeze underneath my jacket, and holding hands; he couldn’t keep his hands off of me. His brothers didn’t seem to blink an eye / they were very nonchalant about it. \n\nHe initiated making plans for all of us to go to an amusement park next weekend (joined by the brothers’ wives), as well as going to a real hockey game together. \n\nThe next time I’m going to see him is this Friday evening at his place. \n\nThe only thing that possibly concerns me a bit is that this guy is a singer based in LA — he has a social media presence and that makes me insecure, especially when a lot of women follow him, etc. Like a “mini” celebrity. Perhaps I’m just insecure? \n\nAlso idk if this is worth mentioning, but his last relationship of 2.5 years ended 3 years ago when his ex-girlfriend cheated on him — with a woman. I can tell that scarred him. We don’t talk much about our past but that is one thing I do know. He hasn’t been in a relationship ever since. For me, I broke up with my exbf of 1 year (international long distance) only 2 weeks ago. Yes, I only met this guy 1 week after I broke up with my ex. He knows this. Ok well now all the cards are on the table! \n\nTLDR: Sorry if I sound thick, but what is going on? Does he seem to want a relationship? Are we more than casually dating? I plan on talking to him more seriously this Friday when I see him for the 5th time, but in the meantime any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. And again, hopefully this is my last post.

He's struggling with severe depression and I think I struggle with some codependency. He is addicted to speed and we both struggle with weed addiction.\u000b\n\nI have a strong opinion of how I wish to be treated in our relationship and those wishes are not always met. I don't know how to stick to my boundaries. They have been stretched after time I guess. I love him and I believe him when he says he will be better. But now is the time where I see there's a pattern here. History repeats itself... How long should I wait for improvement? I know I can't fix anybody but he really say that he want to improve. But I just can't seem to see any effort. Or at least long lasting effort. \n\nOur biggest relationship issue is that we have different views on time and appointments. I have been very clear with him that I don't tolerate any ditching. Due to his illness that has been a problem. Some days he just isn't in the mood and want to be alone. I can totally understand that he needs to be alone on those days and frankly, I don't want to be around him when he's in a bad mood either. But when he agrees a date with me, and then calls last minute to ditch, I can get very annoyed and frustrated with him. I try to explain that I would really like to be informed earlier so I can make other appointments. \n\nSaturday we had planned a date where I was going to cook dinner for him after he did some homework. He got in touch with me around 5 PM and asked if I wanted to go out with him and his friends later. I said sure I'd like that and asked him when he'd be hungry for dinner. He then told me one of the plans had to go and that he just put a pizza in the oven. I get frustrated and said we could do both, we could eat dinner and go meet his friends after. But he just didn't want to do that, because he hasn't started with his homework yet. I get frustrated that he has not planned ahead, and that he's now eating pizza, so I asked him when he planned to eat dinner with me. \n\nThen all hell breaks loose. He's now annoyed that I can't understand that he needs alone time. And I try to explain that's not the issue, the issue is that he's now eating pizza when we had a dinner date planned and that he clearly want to ditch those dinner plans to go out with his friends. He then said \"Fuck it I'm staying home\". Again I try to explain how I don't tolerate being ditched. He replies with a \"You should get your own hobbies and interest so you don't notice it\". And then I just get sad and want to reconsider the whole relationship after being attacked like that. When I state this, he explains that I should know when he's being dramatic (the \"Fuck it Im staying home\" part) and that he didn't mean it, and that we now have a disagreement on something that never happened (he ditching me). I'm still mad because 1. he DID say fuck it, and 2. he said something mean and 3. he's expecting me to know that he's not being serious when we have a serious discussion. \n\nThis all ends with breaking up, I say I can't handle being treated like this every time he's not in the mood and that I'm now going to block him to get some space. He agrees and is sorry for everything. I block him and cry, but deep down I know it's for the best.\n\nNow he's sent me an SMS where he apologies for everything, he is apologising for the mean thing he said and told me he loves me and respects me. He admits that he fucked up and that he's ashamed for what he said to me. He admits that he need to quit speed and weed and that he hope to become normal in a week or two. He said it's very sad if this has ruined the wonderful relationship we have together.\n\nI've seen this text before and frankly this is getting old. I just answered him that I love him but I need some time to think and that I feel I've just seen it too many times now... I love him so much and we do have a wonderful relationship except this thing. I'm willing to quit weed with him so I think I'm going to give this another chance, he seem more willing to fix this now than ever. I'm really scared of being alone so I just had to ask for other people's views on this. \n\nTLDR: Boyfriend is continuously ditching dates with me even after I've been clear with him I don't like it. I feel he's not very considerate of my feelings and have now broken up because of it. He's currently very apologetic and is now willing to stop doing drugs to see if it helps with his behaviour and don't want to break up. He has said these things before when we have had disagreements and I feel that history just keep repeating itself.

If I ignorantly say something wrong, please let me know. I'm trying to learn more about the trans community.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy fiancée (Lucy) has 3 siblings, the second youngest named Charlotte (but she goes by Charlie). She is openly bi (she came out a few years ago) but, as far as I know, has only had relationships with men. Charlie has struggled with her mental health in the past and has had a few traumatic experiences that have greatly affected her. A few months ago, Charlotte confessed to me that she thinks she is transgendered. She told me she has not her sister (Lucy) yet, but she wanted to tell me.\n\nOriginally (for wrong or for right), I took this with a grain of salt – she has said other things along the same vein before, and there was no follow-through on any of it. She often says things just for asn intense reaction, which most people end up just quietly/uncomfortably chuckling at and saying, \"Okay, Charlie\". Recently though, she’s been asking me for advice when it comes to dressing as a male, and other things that don’t seem as relevant to me because they're overly gendered already (colognes, accessories, hair styles, etc.). She also has had stereotypically feminine hobbies in the past, and now she’s asking me about my “manly” interests (many of which I think are not technically “manly” – working out, playing disc golf, videogames, etc) and is abandoning her old interests. She has been asking if I can collect old clothes for her to wear (including things like boxers).  She told me she is someday going to take hormones, but for the time-being, she is wearing traditionally male clothes in private. She also told me she is wearing something to make it look like she has male genitalia when she has clothes on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, for me, there are several things I’m conflicted about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirstly, I try to be an open-minded person, and within the 8 last years I have converted absolutely believing all forms of homosexuality are wrong, to becoming skeptical, to feeling bad about how I used to think and supporting all LGBTQ people (and becoming friends with many in the community along the way). I have not been vocal about it, however, because all of my family members have the mentality that I used to have (they think homosexuality is depraved).\n\nMaybe this is former belief causing ignorance, but I still wonder about transgenderism. I completely acknowledge that people who go through a full shift (hormones, surgeries, etc.) end up feeling more comfortable and happier after the transition is complete. But, I also have heard of scenarios where people do the full transition and end up feeling “wrong” still, and perhaps even worse. Maybe this is wrong, but I’m concerned that she would regret doing the hormones and whole surgery. I’m not sure. I wonder if this is her craving attention and doing what she can to get it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, it’s odd to me that she is trying to get into stereotypical male things – I dress slightly more “feminine” for a male (because I think gendered clothes are silly), but overall, I still have a masculine look. In my opinion, hobbies and clothes should not be gendered. I wonder why she is trying to get into videogames and everything when, at the core, these are not masculine activities. It makes me feel like she is unsure what being a man actually is, because it isn’t just hobbies and clothes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThirdly, she told her parents about it, and they are not pleased. Her dad is more open to it, but even still, her dad makes comments to suggest that he is not wanting to lose a daughter (from what Charlie told me). I think her mom is pretending like it’s not happening (her mom has similar beliefs to my family), or is hoping it is just a phase. Because of this, her mom has not made a big fuss about this. I wonder, though, if me giving Charlie my old clothes will upset the parents and siblings. I am trying to support her, but I also have my own reservations (listed above) and I don’t want to upset her family. Charlie is also very talkative, so I’m wondering if she has already told her dad that I am “helping her” (but I am trying to be neutrally supportive at this stage). I’m not sure if I should reach out to her dad and talk to him about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFourthly, she told me this is something she's been considering since October, when she dressed up as a guy for Halloween. I feel, normally, when someone is transgender, it's something that is in their mind for their whole life. I don't know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, she has not told Lucy (my fiancée) yet. I ended up getting really drunk and breaking down and telling Lucy because I felt so bad keeping it from her (which was absolutely wrong of me, I know). I told my fiancée not to tell Charlie that I know, because I want Charlie to tell her when she feels comfortable. But my fiancée seems to think that it’s just “Charlie being Charlie” and told me to ignore her. I haven’t told my fiancée about her wanting me to collect male clothes, because I don’t want to out Charlie more than I already have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd, to be completely honest, I’m not sure why she reached out to me about it. I am not exactly a prime example of masculinity, nor am I a good example of someone who is completely LGBTQ friendly (though I am, I am not vocal about it). She has also (as I interpreted it) hit on me in the past, and crossed a few lines with me (I’m very reserved, though, so I have more “intimate” boundaries). For example, she has told me my hair is \"hot\" and tried to feel my muscles.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, and I’m very sorry if any of this is insensitive. Please educate me if I am wrong about something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: My fiancees sister came out to me as trans, don't know what to do.","author_fullname":"t2_5eqno1gk","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"My (28M) fiancee's (25F) sister (18F) came out to me as trans.","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationships","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"new","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_fcfu1z","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":12,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"[new]","can_mod_post":false,"score":12,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1583200077,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.relationships","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Sorry in advance if any of this is insensitive.

I’m not sure if I should reach out to her dad and talk to him about it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Fourthly, she told me this is something she&#39;s been considering since October, when she dressed up as a guy for Halloween. I feel, normally, when someone is transgender, it&#39;s something that is in their mind for their whole life. I don&#39;t know.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, she has not told Lucy (my fiancée) yet. I ended up getting really drunk and breaking down and telling Lucy because I felt so bad keeping it from her (which was absolutely wrong of me, I know). I told my fiancée not to tell Charlie that I know, because I want Charlie to tell her when she feels comfortable. But my fiancée seems to think that it’s just “Charlie being Charlie” and told me to ignore her. I haven’t told my fiancée about her wanting me to collect male clothes, because I don’t want to out Charlie more than I already have.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>And, to be completely honest, I’m not sure why she reached out to me about it. I am not exactly a prime example of masculinity, nor am I a good example of someone who is completely LGBTQ friendly (though I am, I am not vocal about it). She has also (as I interpreted it) hit on me in the past, and crossed a few lines with me (I’m very reserved, though, so I have more “intimate” boundaries). For example, she has told me my hair is &quot;hot&quot; and tried to feel my muscles.</p>\n\n<p>Any advice is appreciated, and I’m very sorry if any of this is insensitive. Please educate me if I am wrong about something.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: My fiancees sister came out to me as trans, don&#39;t know what to do.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fcfu1z","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"OldChemist11","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":24,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fcfu1z/my_28m_fiancees_25f_sister_18f_came_out_to_me_as/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fcfu1z/my_28m_fiancees_25f_sister_18f_came_out_to_me_as/","subreddit_subscribers":2795065,"created_utc":1583171277,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"The recent behavior change started before Valentines.

At first it was fine - he participated when we played games, when he does speak not many people listen expect A and I, and he's generally been pretty chill. But recently he's been acting a bit weird.\n\nWe play a game where we flip a milk carton and say something. If the milk lands, then the thing we said comes true. When it was QK's turn, he said, \"If this lands then one of you at this table have to have sex with me!\" which I found odd but shrugged off.\n\nLater the same week, we played a similar game. Someone throws a carton of milk and says \"whoever doesn't catch this (ex. has a third nipple)\" and everyone tries to catch it. When it was QK's turn he said something I didn't hear and threw the milk. Everyone went for it and I caught it. I asked QK what he said, he (excitedly) explained \"I said whoever ***does*** catch this milk has to have sex with me!\". I kinda just shrugged it off, but I still feel pretty weird.\n\nFor some of the more general but probably not as weird stuff I noticed, he sometimes sits a bit close. At my school the lunch chairs are directly attached to the table, so you can't really move them. So usually A saves a seat for her boyfriend and I sit next to her. But a couple of times after it had been established to QK that's how we sit, QK tries to sit next to A when there's plenty of other seats.\n\nI've also gone and sat at the table before everyone else (ie, PLENTY of other seats) and QK still would sit close to me. It feels really weird, especially since I'm not that big and easily feel vulnerable around taller people.\n\nA final thing, he is a bit weird about texting.

At first it was fine - he participated when we played games, when he does speak not many people listen expect A and I, and he&#39;s generally been pretty chill. But recently he&#39;s been acting a bit weird.</p>\n\n<p>We play a game where we flip a milk carton and say something. If the milk lands, then the thing we said comes true. When it was QK&#39;s turn, he said, &quot;If this lands then one of you at this table have to have sex with me!&quot; which I found odd but shrugged off.</p>\n\n<p>Later the same week, we played a similar game. Someone throws a carton of milk and says &quot;whoever doesn&#39;t catch this (ex. has a third nipple)&quot; and everyone tries to catch it. When it was QK&#39;s turn he said something I didn&#39;t hear and threw the milk. Everyone went for it and I caught it. I asked QK what he said, he (excitedly) explained &quot;I said whoever <strong><em>does</em></strong> catch this milk has to have sex with me!&quot;. I kinda just shrugged it off, but I still feel pretty weird.</p>\n\n<p>For some of the more general but probably not as weird stuff I noticed, he sometimes sits a bit close. At my school the lunch chairs are directly attached to the table, so you can&#39;t really move them. So usually A saves a seat for her boyfriend and I sit next to her. But a couple of times after it had been established to QK that&#39;s how we sit, QK tries to sit next to A when there&#39;s plenty of other seats.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve also gone and sat at the table before everyone else (ie, PLENTY of other seats) and QK still would sit close to me. It feels really weird, especially since I&#39;m not that big and easily feel vulnerable around taller people.</p>\n\n<p>A final thing, he is a bit weird about texting. He initially asked A for my number and I agreed because why not. He later texted me really late at night trying to initiate conversation, but I didn&#39;t respond because I was tired.</p>\n\n<p>Am I being dramatic about this, or is something wrong?

This helps me focus, since most of the time I'm working on some very thought heavy algorithms. I like to chat, when the time calls for it, but most times I keep to myself. I live my life 3/4 in my head, and when given the opportunity I tend to recede back into my head whenever possible.\n\nI find that I have a very a \"survivalistic\" brain (yeah I just thought of that, so what), and by that I mean I have a hard time remembering thing that aren't pertinent to my survival. When someone tells stories, I usually pick out the \"valuable\" information and can store and recall that easily, but small \"less-valuable\" info is much harder.\n\nMy GF has a fairly easy job, with lots of people who constantly like to stand around and gossip and create drama. Most of her day is just enduring this.\n\nI like to talk with my GF after work every day, we talk about the usual \"how was your day\", and when I'm asked I try to condense my day into maybe a sentence or two. I leave out all the work BS (unless it's truly that bad where I need to talk to her about it.), and typically only like to report on the good. When I ask her, I get a hour story of \"x did this to y. I can't believe my boss did <insert thing here>.

When her dad buy the 18 yr old prostitute Gf of his some gift, my GF suddenly come and accuse me of buying the janitor girl gifts. Which is insane. because now not only you're claiming I like a janitor, but you're also claiming I like this janitor so much that I buy expensive bags n stuff for her. Which is insane. This is literally delusion. I'm not even kidding. She sees what her dad does, then put my name in it come and accuse me of it. \n\nHas anyone had any unique experience similar to this? What exactly am I supposed to do with this situation? Like she sees the fked up stuff her dad is doing, then she assumes in her small brain that \"OK , ALL MEN MuST BE LIKE THIS\" and come fight with me over what his dad does, just claim I'm doing it too !!!!

Mentioning how he wants to be in her bed and she says to be wary as she will come and visit him one day, other people were mentioning how cute both of them look and should make babies, (the chat were showing off their selfies at the time). Another thing I want to note is how sensitive she is to her looks.. I would barely get to see her face but apparently it’s totally okay on her side to show her face towards a bunch of other people.

We did broke up at one point for a month or two but that was in 2017 while this happened is 2018. \n\nI couldn’t stand the feeling anymore so I confronted my girl about the things I saw. She responded that “it was ages ago and Her and the guy were long time friends.

About a year and a half ago, I introduced my best friend and roommate, B, to a casual friend of mine, D, knowing that neither of them were looking for anything serious and would both be attracted to each other. I wouldn't have ever expected either of them to date, but lo and behold, after that first night he never left our house. About 3 months in, my boyfriend at the time calls me saying D's family is looking for him because his son was just born. I was with B and asked her if she even knew that D was going to have a baby. We were both floored because D had been at our house earlier that day and had left in a sort of weird and hurried manner. B was hurt and shocked but decided to look past it as D explained to her that he was worried that she wouldn't even be interested in him at all if he told her he had a baby on the way. He also told her that he was still married to the baby mama but was working on getting a divorce. \n\nThey continue dating, I move out of state and she moves back in with her parents. D has an apartment but for some reason prefers to stay with B at her parents house. I get texts almost daily from B while I'm gone saying that D barely touches her, he won't tell her he loves her after a year of dating, at some points he won't talk to her and he gets angry when she tries to talk about the issues that they're having or tries to show affection, and he also never lets her see his kid. I try to tell her that he's using her for rides and food because he doesn't have a car and he doesn't make much money at his job. She insists that she loves him and they're meant to be together and blah blah blah. When I moved back after being gone a year, I saw how terribly he treated her, and heard the abusive things he would say to her and again tried to get her to leave. They ended up breaking up around this past Thanksgiving but only for about a month. \n\nWhen they got back together he was acting completely different. He told her he loved her, he got a good job, he was making plans with her and including his kid. Then about a month ago, his wife (that he had never divorced) texts B's mom with multiple screenshots showing that D had been cheating on B within the time that they had gotten back together after their short breakup. B is devastated, doesn't talk to D for a few days but for some reason refuses to cut contact with him. At this point, D starts acting desperate, writing her long letters every day telling her how much he loves her and can't live without her, showing up at her job (she works at a restaurant) and hanging around until she gets off of work, and showing up at the bars he knows she frequents (he actually got kicked out of one of these bars for hitting a friend of his bc they said they were tired of hearing his sob story. This is important later). B is kind of weirded out but I can tell that she likes the attention because he had never acted anything like this the whole time they were dating. All the while her other friends and I are telling her it wouldn't be a bad idea to get a restraining order on him. \n\nEverything came to a head one night about 2 weeks ago. B texted me asking me if I would go hang out at her work because D was there and was drunk despite the fact that he wasn't supposed to be drinking on his antidepressants. I went up and D was terribly drunk, just sitting at the bar of the restaurant staring at B and going back and forth between the restaurant and the bar next door. He tried speaking to me and after I told him I didn't want to talk to him, he began yelling \"I'm sorry\" over and over again across the bar of the restaurant. When B got off of work I told D he needed to go home and leave us alone and B and I went to the bar next door for a drink. D walks in shortly after so we decided to go to the bar from which he was banned. I told B I was going to meet her there and after about 10 min of her not showing up I called her and she said she had brought D home bc she didn't want him driving but when they got to his place, he wouldn't get out of her car. I told her I was going to call the cops and she begged me not to. She finally called me back about 5 min later saying he had gotten out and she was on the way. Fast forward about 20 minutes, we're sitting at the bar and the bartender hands her a shot of liquor that she would typically take with D. We joked saying what if he was there and had sent her the shot but agreed the bartender would have kicked him out. Lo and behold, I look at the end of the bar and D is sitting there looking at us with a creepy smile, a jacket pulled up around his neck, and a hat pulled down low. The poor bartender was new and did not know that he was banned, so I quickly informed her despite B's protests (I don't know why she was protesting). I watched D get into an Uber and drive away. B and I left the bar shortly after, and when she arrived home she called me saying D was at her house and had snuck in when she let her dog out. I told her to either call the cops or wake her parents up bc he is stalking her. I tried to call her mom but got no answer bc it was the middle of the night. She let him stay in her room and she slept on the couch, and when she got up for class in the morning, D walked out of the room and her dad saw that he was there. He was pissed and they both left and locked D out of the house. \n\nI get a call around noon that day from B saying that D's mom called her and they were worried D had killed himself as he had told everyone he loved them and then wouldn't answer his phone for the last several hours. The last place he had told anyone he was was at B's house so D's mom was heading to the house with a pastor. I checked his ig story and it said \"it's been real everyone\".  B called me back a bit later and said when she got home from class D was sitting in the driveway talking to the pastor. He had never left her house and had tied a noose around their basketball goal. They brought him to the psych ward and he was there for at least a week. Now B is almost acting as if absolutely nothing has happened. I have made it very clear that after everything that went down, I do not trust D and I don't like him very much at all either. I've tried to tell her that people do not just change overnight. This is the concensus of all of her other friends and her family as well. She keeps inviting D around when we get together as just girls without asking or telling us ahead of time, she invited him to celebrate Mardi Gras with us without mentioning to me that he would be there, she tried to invite him to a get together at one of my friends houses that I was bringing her along to...it's just ridiculous. She keeps telling us to just get over it, it's her choice to be with him and we need to be his friend. I don't know what to do. I think he's not a good person and he's not someone I want to be friends with. I have a hard time being nice to him when I see him and he barely even acknowledges me anymore anyway, as he sees me as a threat to his relationship with B because I'm honest with her about how I feel about him. I don't want to lose my friendship with her but I also don't want to encourage her relationship with him.

I agreed and we went on to date for a year and a half. Towards the end she was quite withdrawn from me and that was really affecting my sense of selfworth in and out of the relationship. \n\nWe met again after my friends had a party, initially we didn't speak a word to each other. Then by the end we were laughing as if no one else was there but us. At the time I had a long term girlfriend and she had some short relationships, most noteable one 8 month relationship which ended one month ago (so very recent). This spark affected my relationship quite badly and I ended up breaking up with the girl 2 months later. She then dated the afformentioned guy for 8 months after I became single. \n\nNow we are both single, we've been really close at parties always being drawn to each other and having a laugh. To be fully transperant I have never felt like this about another person before, she isn't flawless but to me she is amazing and she has the best personality I have ever encountered. Last saturday she threw a party, there was lots of drinking and crying while i cruised by happily, then she said we were also due for a chat - which threw me out. I stayed up all night thinking \"oh my god what if what I had been feeling was mutual.\" The next day we had friends there all day until it was finally night time and I brought it up, very openly said that yes I again felt for her and liked her, and she also agreed. For the next week we spoke very openly and communicated every feeling, concern and thought we had about the whole thing. Then last tuesday we played sport together, I carpooled from her house but also I wanted us to have our own time again. Our friends slept over but we finally got some alone time at 3am, where we spoke about everything then, I really was fighting this because I didn't want to be a rebound, but we had sex. We agreed not to tell our friends because they have their own agendas in this, 2 of them have gotten back together to break up horribly. We spent the entire next day together, very much loved up. Cuddling, kissing and making up for lost sleep while watching movies. I cooked her dinner and we had a big chat on the couch. We previously noted that I was far more ready for a relationship than she was (I have been single for 9 months and her only 1) and that she needed her time. She initially ment 3 years in trying again but we agreed that was a bit unrealistic. In our chat we discussed putting a pin in it, essentially going back to last sunday before we confessed how we felt, baack to being close friends and knowing that we feel attraction for each other but not so it consumes our lives. My fear here is, I know she wants to go out with her friends, perhaps sleep around a bit and to live her life without worrying about someone else's feelings. But I really like this girl, and I could say that I would happily live my life with her (and no, I didn't wait 3 years for this. I did get over her completely, I didn't hold out for our remeeting, this whole thing is us meeting and having grown so much and developing feelings again). She said us waiting is good because not only is she not ready yet, but it also stops us from keeping this whole thing up and ending up dating in a couple of weeks time and her not being ready to ruin something potentially amazing. \n\nNow I am in a dilemma, I really like her, she occupies my thoughts like no one can. I want to be with her without a doubt in my mind. She's also told me she really likes me, physically and emotionally as a person. But I am worried that she in this time may just sporatically find a boy and do that, instead of waiting until she's ready and telling me so we can try again. How much time is time? It's fully up to her and that is terrifying for me having caught feelings and then having to supress them holding out for something that may never happen. I told her that we may miss our chance, she replied that we are always attracted to each other, is it possible for us to miss our shot? or Does that just delay us getting together. Which I didn't really like because I treat breakups as if that person has been deleted from my life.\n\nMy small plan was that I start my masters project soon, time will fly when I am full time and the girls in our group are hyping a june/july wild time during the break. My idea of what to do from now was just to focus on myself, interact with her nicely and openly as we always do but not be needy. Do my masters, and before I know it it's the holidays, we have a group trip organised together. After that I will approach her and tell her that this is my time, I have done what I needed to for me (with regard to studies and career) she's had 5 months of living a sporadic life, I want more. If she can't offer that to me then I will have to treat it like a complete breakup and distance myself.

I feel it is disrespectful towards me. I made the mistake of snooping (judge me, I understand)  and saw stuff I did not like.\n\nFor example, one of her exes that she keeps in touch with asked her a couple of times to send him a photo because he missed her smile.\n\nOr I know (from a third party) she went camping with the other guy (before we were together) and stay in the same tent with him and his new gf. And to be honest, she can do whatever she wants before me, but, I really do not like this and I am trying to see things from her perspective.\n\nWhen I confronted her about it, she said they are just friends, nothing more. \n\nBut, for one, can you really be friends with a guy you had sexual relationships with?

He is an amazing person in so many ways and I truly think so highly of him. I’m still so in love with him and so into him.\n\nI want to end our relationship because I feel alone in it. I feel that I carry most of the real life burdens and I think he would agree. \n\nI know that I’m to blame for the majority of that, I know I often take control of many situations just on instinct. I’m a decision maker and a planner, I never thought it would be a negative thing.  and at first I figured he just liked to go with the flow and was passive, but could make decisions when he needed to. However, in our years together I’ve found that in many ways he requires constant instruction, he also is a chronic procrastinator and is very avoidant of responsibilities. I feel that he puts his needs above mine more than I’d like. \n\nIn situations where I am the one who need his help or when I need him to be in the drivers seat, he doesn’t come through. He’s not always reliable or there when I need him or how I need him. I’m not talking about little stuff, I mean for big life things. \n\nI had surgery last year to remove a mass from my cervix that was massive. They had to put me under and dilate me and cut it off and left stitches in. I unfortunately could not take the following day off work (he was unemployed at the time and but I had no PTO left) but I work from home so it wasn’t an issue. The only thing I couldn’t do was lift over 20 pounds and walk comfortably, I was otherwise ok. We agreed he would walk the dog that next day (usually I do in the mornings). \n\nhe ends up sleeping in which was no prob, I went in to wake him because the dog was crying around 10am and he would not wake up. He then said he felt really sick and asked if I could walk her. I said no, reminded him I had surgery the day before and she pulls so it would be painful for me. \n\nIn the end I did cave and walk the dog. He apologized a lot, said he doesn’t remember half the conversation and was really sorry. We almost broke up because I really needed him and that hadn’t been the first time he had put himself first when I was vulnerable. It wasn’t the first time I had asked for help and he said he would but didn’t. \n\nNow three weeks ago I needed a more serious pelvic surgery (last surgery I’d probably need until old age lol). This time I had my mom come stay with us (from another state) even tho he has the week off from work at his new job. I tell him all I need for him to do is load the dishwasher (I don’t trust my mom with that lol) and walk the dog because the dog is afraid of strangers and doesn’t know my mom. My sister also came to stay with us for support. \n\nHe had been sick in the days before my surgery. I asked him to go to the doctor for antibiotics but I was really busy with work, couldn’t schedule an appointment for him. He never went. \n\nHe isn’t helpful in the first day of post op, he’s stressed with anything my mom and sister say or do. He doesn’t help around the house because he feels sick and he doesn’t help my mom with the dog. \n\nHe starts feeling more sick that night, goes to urgent care finally, and they diagnose him with a flu. \n\nI ask him to go to a hotel so I don’t get sick and I have no hard feelings over that. I get we all get sick. When he comes back two days later feeling better, my mom and sister fly home and I can walk pretty okay. I’m up and about but still not able to do much for long. \n\nDoctors orders are to walk around and resume basic activities but no work for two to four weeks. \n\nhe doesn’t help me with anything unless I ask. It is so humiliating to have to ask for so many things when you’re sick... and I also hate asking for help in general. I told him my feelings on this as soon as I noticed him not being very attentive. He apologized and explained he was just still having side effects of his flu and I understand but even after that, it was the same. \n\nHe was also emotionally unavailable because he has depression and had gone back to work the same day he came back from the hotel (hates his job and it’s draining)\n\nAlthough I could walk, I asked him to walk the dog in the mornings or asked if we should hire a walker. He said of course he will walk her and then woke up late every single day. I really struggled the first and second time and then got a walker every day since but I still have to go downstairs to get the walker in which sucks. He apologized and promised he would get up but I hired the walker anyway\n\nHe and I both have mental health issues. I have ptsd from an extreme childhood situation and he has depression and anxiety. I pushed him to get treatment two years ago. He is struggling a lot, is extremely lazy because of his depression. I go to therapy weekly and he stopped going three months ago because he forgot to schedule his appointments. \n\nBut I can’t really get over these things. There’s more but I can’t get it all out.... I know these two situations are bad. But there are good stories of him too 😔 more good than bad and I know it’s not something that he scaled... I just love him and want it to be him. \n\nHe’s offered couples therapy, he’s desperately sorry and doesn’t know why he did all of this. But I feel like we have done this song and dance over and over again with these same issues. He’s in need of constant direction, when I need help he panics, he isn’t proactive in things, won’t communicate with me what his needs are.

He is an amazing person in so many ways and I truly think so highly of him. I’m still so in love with him and so into him.</p>\n\n<p>I want to end our relationship because I feel alone in it. I feel that I carry most of the real life burdens and I think he would agree. </p>\n\n<p>I know that I’m to blame for the majority of that, I know I often take control of many situations just on instinct. I’m a decision maker and a planner, I never thought it would be a negative thing.  and at first I figured he just liked to go with the flow and was passive, but could make decisions when he needed to. However, in our years together I’ve found that in many ways he requires constant instruction, he also is a chronic procrastinator and is very avoidant of responsibilities. I feel that he puts his needs above mine more than I’d like. </p>\n\n<p>In situations where I am the one who need his help or when I need him to be in the drivers seat, he doesn’t come through. He’s not always reliable or there when I need him or how I need him. I’m not talking about little stuff, I mean for big life things. </p>\n\n<p>I had surgery last year to remove a mass from my cervix that was massive. They had to put me under and dilate me and cut it off and left stitches in. I unfortunately could not take the following day off work (he was unemployed at the time and but I had no PTO left) but I work from home so it wasn’t an issue. The only thing I couldn’t do was lift over 20 pounds and walk comfortably, I was otherwise ok. We agreed he would walk the dog that next day (usually I do in the mornings). </p>\n\n<p>he ends up sleeping in which was no prob, I went in to wake him because the dog was crying around 10am and he would not wake up. He then said he felt really sick and asked if I could walk her. I said no, reminded him I had surgery the day before and she pulls so it would be painful for me. </p>\n\n<p>In the end I did cave and walk the dog. He apologized a lot, said he doesn’t remember half the conversation and was really sorry. We almost broke up because I really needed him and that hadn’t been the first time he had put himself first when I was vulnerable. It wasn’t the first time I had asked for help and he said he would but didn’t. </p>\n\n<p>Now three weeks ago I needed a more serious pelvic surgery (last surgery I’d probably need until old age lol). This time I had my mom come stay with us (from another state) even tho he has the week off from work at his new job. I tell him all I need for him to do is load the dishwasher (I don’t trust my mom with that lol) and walk the dog because the dog is afraid of strangers and doesn’t know my mom. My sister also came to stay with us for support. </p>\n\n<p>He had been sick in the days before my surgery. I asked him to go to the doctor for antibiotics but I was really busy with work, couldn’t schedule an appointment for him. He never went. </p>\n\n<p>He isn’t helpful in the first day of post op, he’s stressed with anything my mom and sister say or do. He doesn’t help around the house because he feels sick and he doesn’t help my mom with the dog. </p>\n\n<p>He starts feeling more sick that night, goes to urgent care finally, and they diagnose him with a flu. </p>\n\n<p>I ask him to go to a hotel so I don’t get sick and I have no hard feelings over that. I get we all get sick. When he comes back two days later feeling better, my mom and sister fly home and I can walk pretty okay. I’m up and about but still not able to do much for long. </p>\n\n<p>Doctors orders are to walk around and resume basic activities but no work for two to four weeks. </p>\n\n<p>he doesn’t help me with anything unless I ask. It is so humiliating to have to ask for so many things when you’re sick... and I also hate asking for help in general. I told him my feelings on this as soon as I noticed him not being very attentive. He apologized and explained he was just still having side effects of his flu and I understand but even after that, it was the same. </p>\n\n<p>He was also emotionally unavailable because he has depression and had gone back to work the same day he came back from the hotel (hates his job and it’s draining)</p>\n\n<p>Although I could walk, I asked him to walk the dog in the mornings or asked if we should hire a walker. He said of course he will walk her and then woke up late every single day. I really struggled the first and second time and then got a walker every day since but I still have to go downstairs to get the walker in which sucks. He apologized and promised he would get up but I hired the walker anyway</p>\n\n<p>He and I both have mental health issues. I have ptsd from an extreme childhood situation and he has depression and anxiety. I pushed him to get treatment two years ago. He is struggling a lot, is extremely lazy because of his depression. I go to therapy weekly and he stopped going three months ago because he forgot to schedule his appointments. </p>\n\n<p>But I can’t really get over these things. There’s more but I can’t get it all out.... I know these two situations are bad. But there are good stories of him too 😔 more good than bad and I know it’s not something that he scaled... I just love him and want it to be him. </p>\n\n<p>He’s offered couples therapy, he’s desperately sorry and doesn’t know why he did all of this. But I feel like we have done this song and dance over and over again with these same issues. He’s in need of constant direction, when I need help he panics, he isn’t proactive in things, won’t communicate with me what his needs are. If you need direction for everything just fucking tell me so at least we are on the same page. </p>\n\n<p>I do not believe he will change, I think this is how  he is when he is sick or under pressure.

He wants me to dump my bf so that he and I can have a go at a relationship.\n\nThis is not happening under any circumstances. I love my bf dearly and nothing is ever changing that. I am not attracted to my friend, and purely see him as a friend. There is no sexual chemistry or romantic spark there whatsoever.\n\nNow I'm really torn as to what to do. I see my friend regularly, but now I feel as though I can't as I want to be respectful and loyal to by BF, but I feel as though I owe it to my friend to be there for him too as we have been friends for so long and we are genuinely such good friends and so close.\n\nI do not want to cut my friend out of my life, even though I think this would be the best option for my BF as I do not want to upset him by seeing my friend, as I have been honest with them and told him what my friend has said, and understandably he is not too pleased about the situation.\n\nI also feel as though I can't cut out my friend as we have been friends for so long and I would be worried about his mental state of mind if I were to do so and he may do something to himself. I could never live with myself if that happened.\n\nSomeone is going to end up getting hurt in all of this. Well, I'm already hurting as it's such a horrible situation to be in, my friend is hurting because he cannot be with me, and obviously this is upsetting to my BF too. I would be upset if one of his friends was hitting on him and making a play for him like this.\n\nI'm just not sure how to deal with this situation.\n\nI see a long future with my BF, but I've had a long past with my friend.

She wouldn't even consider it. Then all of the sudden ten years flashed in front of my eyes and I just saw a miserable future, not just for myself, but for the both of us. So now that's why she's my ex and not my fiancée.\n\nAfter our split, a few weeks go by and I'm chatting w/ a different mutual friend, and they casually bring up how I felt about X and MF. I was confused and asked them to elaborate, come to find found out she slept w/ MF 2 days after we split. I was more upset than angry, then I was angry, then I was sad. And tbh, if it had been some random guy, I honestly would've let it go, but the fact that I considered this guy a good friend, and she multiple times expressed how unattractive she thought he was, and how she would never sleep w/ him, and that she thought he was creepy, is what really did it in for me. Now, before anyone blames the one friend for telling me this, they were 100% under the idea that I knew, because that's what they were told. They were in no way trying to be malicious towards X or MF.\n\nSo I asked X about it, because we had planned to try and stay friends, MF as well, but I couldn't just be in the same room as them, knowing what I knew, so I felt I at least needed to talk to her about it, and SHE WENT OFF. Asking how I knew, who told me, the whole 9. I refused to tell her, stating its not important. This went on for days. She says I shouldn't even be mad because we were broken up(agreed), and I tried to use that argument with her, saying what if I slept with so and so, and she said that would never happen, so and so would never sleep with me, and I said she told me the same thing about MF and look what happened. She also went on the say how he and I weren't even that close(he personally called me a great friend of his) blah blah blah. During this, her friends are texting me saying I need to tell her, I'm causing a rift in the friend group, I'm an asshole for finding out(I wasn't even trying to find out in the first place). Total shitstorm. \n\nAfter a while, it dies down. X and I have a talk and I told her, out of respect for the other people, I won't tell her who it was. She accepts this. Well, a few days ago it was brought up by someone who wasn't a part of this, but he said that I was a complete asshole for not saying who it was that told, I politely invited him to fuck off, and not bring up things he had no hand in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I didn't tell my ex which friend told me about her sleeping with a mutual friend, and am wondering if I did the right thing.","author_fullname":"t2_5uvyk8v1","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"I(28M) did not tell my Ex(24F) who ratted them out, about sleeping with a mutual friend","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationships","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"m-be breakups","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_fe60rd","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":33,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Breakups","can_mod_post":false,"score":33,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1583487637,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.relationships","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I posted this in another sub, but it got removed because it was about a relationship, it was initially an AITA, but now I just want to know how I could handle this type of situation if (god forbid) im put in it again.  </p>\n\n<p>This happened months ago, and has since been resolved, but it was brought up again recently.</p>\n\n<p>X - EX</p>\n\n<p>MF - Mutual Friend</p>\n\n<p>This is a Throwaway.</p>\n\n<p>So, like the title says, I(28M) did not reveal who a certain person was, that told me some sensitive info about my ex(23F). </p>\n\n<p>Just a little BG.

She wouldn&#39;t even consider it. Then all of the sudden ten years flashed in front of my eyes and I just saw a miserable future, not just for myself, but for the both of us. So now that&#39;s why she&#39;s my ex and not my fiancée.</p>\n\n<p>After our split, a few weeks go by and I&#39;m chatting w/ a different mutual friend, and they casually bring up how I felt about X and MF. I was confused and asked them to elaborate, come to find found out she slept w/ MF 2 days after we split. I was more upset than angry, then I was angry, then I was sad. And tbh, if it had been some random guy, I honestly would&#39;ve let it go, but the fact that I considered this guy a good friend, and she multiple times expressed how unattractive she thought he was, and how she would never sleep w/ him, and that she thought he was creepy, is what really did it in for me. Now, before anyone blames the one friend for telling me this, they were 100% under the idea that I knew, because that&#39;s what they were told. They were in no way trying to be malicious towards X or MF.</p>\n\n<p>So I asked X about it, because we had planned to try and stay friends, MF as well, but I couldn&#39;t just be in the same room as them, knowing what I knew, so I felt I at least needed to talk to her about it, and SHE WENT OFF. Asking how I knew, who told me, the whole 9. I refused to tell her, stating its not important. This went on for days. She says I shouldn&#39;t even be mad because we were broken up(agreed), and I tried to use that argument with her, saying what if I slept with so and so, and she said that would never happen, so and so would never sleep with me, and I said she told me the same thing about MF and look what happened. She also went on the say how he and I weren&#39;t even that close(he personally called me a great friend of his) blah blah blah. During this, her friends are texting me saying I need to tell her, I&#39;m causing a rift in the friend group, I&#39;m an asshole for finding out(I wasn&#39;t even trying to find out in the first place). Total shitstorm. </p>\n\n<p>After a while, it dies down. X and I have a talk and I told her, out of respect for the other people, I won&#39;t tell her who it was. She accepts this. Well, a few days ago it was brought up by someone who wasn&#39;t a part of this, but he said that I was a complete asshole for not saying who it was that told, I politely invited him to fuck off, and not bring up things he had no hand in. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR I didn&#39;t tell my ex which friend told me about her sleeping with a mutual friend, and am wondering if I did the right thing.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"05d9361c-cb01-11e2-b494-12313d262949","can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fe60rd","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"tossingitout2020","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":25,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fe60rd/i28m_did_not_tell_my_ex24f_who_ratted_them_out/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fe60rd/i28m_did_not_tell_my_ex24f_who_ratted_them_out/","subreddit_subscribers":2795065,"created_utc":1583458837,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"My bf(lets call him Mike) and I were both dating around when we met.

info that's pertinent:** i had a tumultuous teenage stage where i was definitely a problem child. i had issues with alcohol and having some serious bouts of anorexia, bulimia, and EDNOS (eating disorder not otherwise specified) that resulted in 3 hospitalizations to get my health on track. when i would drink, i would become a very angry person in regards to my parents, often fighting with them when i came home from whatever havoc i was wreaking. this resulted in screaming matches and trauma for both my parents and myself. this continued into my early twenties, especially during my very physically and emotionally abusive 3 year relationship. once i finally got out of that situation, i drastically cleaned up my act, refraining from excessive drinking or any other behavior that would result in negative effects. i still have a tricky relationship with food, but i haven't been at an unhealthy weight in 4 years. i am also a lot more mellow now, i make good decisions, i don't hang out with people that i could get into tricky predicaments with, i don't come home drunk, i don't do drugs (never did drugs, except for weed, but that never elicited any problems with anyone). i am still in college (i took off 3 years and switched majors) and live at home with my mom, dad, and dog. i realize i am EXTREMELY privileged to have such amazing and unconditional love and support (emotionally, financially, and with my interests and schooling). my relationship with my parents has drastically improved, i follow all rules they set (minimal, mostly \"be considerate\" types of things; let them know where i am, when i'm coming home, who i'm with, etc.), and we do not have any big blow ups anymore because i am a much better person and daughter since i've grown up and gone through therapy.\n\n**the current issues with my dad:** while my father has a nasty temper, we get along. the only issue i have with my father is that he tracks my every financial move since he has access to my mobile banking. up until a few months ago, he also tracked my phone location very closely (he is now retired and has nothing to focus on but me, golf, and his television shows). this resulted in several problems. for example, a few months ago, i dropped my friend off at her grandparents' house before i went to class at 7:30 am. my mother knew i was doing this, but i neglected to tell my father because the information didn't seem very important and he wasn't awake before i left. after i dropped her off, i went on my way to school. i stopped at a stop sign which happened to be right next to a liquor store. mind you, this is around 7:45 in the morning and the liquor store was NOT OPEN. he called me in a rage accusing me of going to the liquor store, which obviously made me very upset since he refused to believe me. at that point i had to pull over. i sent him a screen shot of the liquor store website with the hours clearly stating that it did not open until 10 am and he still would not stop yelling and being accusatory. i called my mother who was very angry with my father for being so irrational and making me cry and panicked while driving (i have about an hour long commute to school). she in turn called him and diffused the situation, but it was really, really upsetting to me, especially because i had not had even a sip of alcohol in over a year, and did not have any anger or alcohol fueled confrontations for a much longer period. another example is when i was visiting a friend at an apartment complex he and his father were renovating and he was staying in (so that squatters wouldn't break in), in a moderately shady part of town. i was completely safe though, he walked me to and from my car which was parked directly in from of the complex. my father called me again in a rage and forced me to leave. i am 26 years old. i feel like this is completely irrational and **EXTREMELY embarrassing**. i was never doing anything wrong and my father would needlessly and religiously checked my location and charges at all times. thankfully, my parents no longer track my location and things have improved. but i have still extreme anxiety about going to innocuous places with my friends. i also feel like it's hard for me to date because i don't always want to tell my parents that i'm going to hang out with someone from tinder. i'm 26 and feel like i don't even have sexual freedom because my parents want to know EVERYTHING. i feel like i can't even go to a pub for lunch because my dad will see that i went to a place that, god forbid, sells alcohol.\n\n**current issues with my mom:** my mother is a very naturally anxious person. i understand completely that my past actions triggered some of this and that she has a right to be put at ease, but i also feel like my behavior and actions over the past 3 years should elicit more trust. i always call my mother and i always let her know whats going on, who i'm with, what i'm doing. if i smoke weed, i tell my mom and let her know that i shouldn't be driving. she is fine with my weed use because it is not at all problematic (unless i have an edible or smoke a bit and don't want to drive, which is just an inconvenience that results in an unplanned sleepover at my best friend's house, which just annoys her because its unplanned). unplanned things throw her for a loop, even if there are no negative connotations. this is very rare, because usually when i do hang out with my best friend, i usually do plan ahead to sleepover because she lives an hour away. i really don't hang out with anyone consistently except for my best friend, and my parents love her, so it's not a huge issue. however, another issue with my mother is with my very reliable and safe car. she hates when i drive long distances, especially if it's at night. although i am not explicitly *not allowed* to go places and do things, i often turn down lots of fun activities and opportunities with people other than my best friend because i do not want to cause any anxiety for my mother. my best friend does not drink at all, so she is 'safe' in their minds. i feel very frustrated by this, because i am an adult. i know that i live at home and i need to be respectful of my parents, but it's hard for me on an internal and psychological level to hang out with other people because of the potential anxiety it could cause her. i spend tons of time at home and enjoy spending time with both my parents, but i can't help but feel extremely restricted and unable to breathe. another very frustrating situation is that my mother seems to think i am incapable of being around people who are drinking without going on a bender despite ample evidence that haven't gotten drunk and come home in several years or had any issues in relation to that. that deeply restricts what i (internally) feel like i can do with my peers, since many social get togethers or outings involve alcohol. my mother has made more headway in the trust department, but for me it is internalized apprehension at almost all times. the biggest thing is that i am her whole world. she loves me so much and loves to be around me, but i am her everything and she is constantly thinking about me and what i'm doing. she once called me from work because she knew i was driving to work, and she heard sirens driving by her work (located pretty close to mine) because she was afraid i got into an accident. to me, this is ridiculous. she has told me on several occasions that she compulsively prays for me whenever i am not home, no matter what

SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>background info that&#39;s pertinent:</strong> i had a tumultuous teenage stage where i was definitely a problem child. i had issues with alcohol and having some serious bouts of anorexia, bulimia, and EDNOS (eating disorder not otherwise specified) that resulted in 3 hospitalizations to get my health on track. when i would drink, i would become a very angry person in regards to my parents, often fighting with them when i came home from whatever havoc i was wreaking. this resulted in screaming matches and trauma for both my parents and myself. this continued into my early twenties, especially during my very physically and emotionally abusive 3 year relationship. once i finally got out of that situation, i drastically cleaned up my act, refraining from excessive drinking or any other behavior that would result in negative effects. i still have a tricky relationship with food, but i haven&#39;t been at an unhealthy weight in 4 years. i am also a lot more mellow now, i make good decisions, i don&#39;t hang out with people that i could get into tricky predicaments with, i don&#39;t come home drunk, i don&#39;t do drugs (never did drugs, except for weed, but that never elicited any problems with anyone). i am still in college (i took off 3 years and switched majors) and live at home with my mom, dad, and dog. i realize i am EXTREMELY privileged to have such amazing and unconditional love and support (emotionally, financially, and with my interests and schooling). my relationship with my parents has drastically improved, i follow all rules they set (minimal, mostly &quot;be considerate&quot; types of things; let them know where i am, when i&#39;m coming home, who i&#39;m with, etc.), and we do not have any big blow ups anymore because i am a much better person and daughter since i&#39;ve grown up and gone through therapy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>the current issues with my dad:</strong> while my father has a nasty temper, we get along. the only issue i have with my father is that he tracks my every financial move since he has access to my mobile banking. up until a few months ago, he also tracked my phone location very closely (he is now retired and has nothing to focus on but me, golf, and his television shows). this resulted in several problems. for example, a few months ago, i dropped my friend off at her grandparents&#39; house before i went to class at 7:30 am. my mother knew i was doing this, but i neglected to tell my father because the information didn&#39;t seem very important and he wasn&#39;t awake before i left. after i dropped her off, i went on my way to school. i stopped at a stop sign which happened to be right next to a liquor store. mind you, this is around 7:45 in the morning and the liquor store was NOT OPEN. he called me in a rage accusing me of going to the liquor store, which obviously made me very upset since he refused to believe me. at that point i had to pull over. i sent him a screen shot of the liquor store website with the hours clearly stating that it did not open until 10 am and he still would not stop yelling and being accusatory. i called my mother who was very angry with my father for being so irrational and making me cry and panicked while driving (i have about an hour long commute to school). she in turn called him and diffused the situation, but it was really, really upsetting to me, especially because i had not had even a sip of alcohol in over a year, and did not have any anger or alcohol fueled confrontations for a much longer period. another example is when i was visiting a friend at an apartment complex he and his father were renovating and he was staying in (so that squatters wouldn&#39;t break in), in a moderately shady part of town. i was completely safe though, he walked me to and from my car which was parked directly in from of the complex. my father called me again in a rage and forced me to leave. i am 26 years old. i feel like this is completely irrational and <strong>EXTREMELY embarrassing</strong>. i was never doing anything wrong and my father would needlessly and religiously checked my location and charges at all times. thankfully, my parents no longer track my location and things have improved. but i have still extreme anxiety about going to innocuous places with my friends. i also feel like it&#39;s hard for me to date because i don&#39;t always want to tell my parents that i&#39;m going to hang out with someone from tinder. i&#39;m 26 and feel like i don&#39;t even have sexual freedom because my parents want to know EVERYTHING. i feel like i can&#39;t even go to a pub for lunch because my dad will see that i went to a place that, god forbid, sells alcohol.</p>\n\n<p><strong>current issues with my mom:</strong> my mother is a very naturally anxious person. i understand completely that my past actions triggered some of this and that she has a right to be put at ease, but i also feel like my behavior and actions over the past 3 years should elicit more trust. i always call my mother and i always let her know whats going on, who i&#39;m with, what i&#39;m doing. if i smoke weed, i tell my mom and let her know that i shouldn&#39;t be driving. she is fine with my weed use because it is not at all problematic (unless i have an edible or smoke a bit and don&#39;t want to drive, which is just an inconvenience that results in an unplanned sleepover at my best friend&#39;s house, which just annoys her because its unplanned). unplanned things throw her for a loop, even if there are no negative connotations. this is very rare, because usually when i do hang out with my best friend, i usually do plan ahead to sleepover because she lives an hour away. i really don&#39;t hang out with anyone consistently except for my best friend, and my parents love her, so it&#39;s not a huge issue. however, another issue with my mother is with my very reliable and safe car. she hates when i drive long distances, especially if it&#39;s at night. although i am not explicitly <em>not allowed</em> to go places and do things, i often turn down lots of fun activities and opportunities with people other than my best friend because i do not want to cause any anxiety for my mother. my best friend does not drink at all, so she is &#39;safe&#39; in their minds. i feel very frustrated by this, because i am an adult. i know that i live at home and i need to be respectful of my parents, but it&#39;s hard for me on an internal and psychological level to hang out with other people because of the potential anxiety it could cause her. i spend tons of time at home and enjoy spending time with both my parents, but i can&#39;t help but feel extremely restricted and unable to breathe. another very frustrating situation is that my mother seems to think i am incapable of being around people who are drinking without going on a bender despite ample evidence that haven&#39;t gotten drunk and come home in several years or had any issues in relation to that. that deeply restricts what i (internally) feel like i can do with my peers, since many social get togethers or outings involve alcohol. my mother has made more headway in the trust department, but for me it is internalized apprehension at almost all times. the biggest thing is that i am her whole world. she loves me so much and loves to be around me, but i am her everything and she is constantly thinking about me and what i&#39;m doing. she once called me from work because she knew i was driving to work, and she heard sirens driving by her work (located pretty close to mine) because she was afraid i got into an accident. to me, this is ridiculous. she has told me on several occasions that she compulsively prays for me whenever i am not home, no matter what context this is in. i mentioned before that i feel like i don&#39;t have sexual or romantic freedom and this is mainly because my mother watches way too much dateline and perceives every single one of my potential suitors as a serious threat. this is difficult because she is from a very different generation and

you guys, I am just kinda heart broken right now.

It was routine for me to spend the night at his place, and we would just hang out until 3 am talking. We even stopped having sex after the second month because it felt weird. He introduced me to his church and took me on a spring vacation with his church members and he met my mother. Again, the sex has stopped.\n\n\nWhen summer came along he had to go back to his home country, and I told him when he gets back to bring me a small gift. We didn’t talk all summer, but when he came back he immediately contacts me and we meet up. He brings me gifts and said he was feeling amazing. He was ready to start over and focus on his grades since they were slipping due to his depression and his parents were threatening him.\n\n\nI mentioned I got back with my ex, but he seemed happy for me. We left happy. We hung out again 2 weeks later and he invited me to come hang out with his friend. I declined. I was then invited to go to church with him but had to cancel because of work.\n\n\nThe ghosting happened here: I asked him to see the joker movie with me in theaters. He canceled and I guess he felt bad and said we could go the next day.

This is a little bit of a complicated situation. Some basic background here- I (26F) moved out of state (in the US) about 8 months ago. At the time I had been with my boyfriend (25M) for a little over a year. We have now been together for a little over 2 years. \n\nSome info on my reasons for moving- financial and family. the lease on my apartment in my home state wasn’t renewed and I had 60 days to move out. When this happened I knew I wasn’t going to be able to afford to stay in my home state, as I was living paycheck to paycheck and had no way to pay for a deposit on a new apartment that would certainly be higher rent. In the months prior to this incident my parents had already been planning to move out of state back to their home state, to be closer to my grandparents who are elderly and not doing well health wise. My parents offered for me to move with them and would pay my plane ticket and moving costs. Since I couldn’t afford to stay it seemed like the best option, and I did want to be closer to my grandparents since they aren’t well. \n\nMy boyfriend knew this and did not offer for us to try and find a place together (we live separately) until a week before I was already scheduled to move out of state. He got mad at the fact that I told him no, but at that point I already had a plane ticket and all my stuff was on the moving truck, and my car was already on its way to my new state. \n\nI told him when I decided my only option was to move, that if he did not want to do long distance I understood. I stressed to him that it would be very difficult to maintain a long distance relationship even with perfect daily communication. He insisted he didn’t want to break up and that he would “wait for me” to come back. He promised to come visit for my birthday and just never did. Never brought it up again either. \n\nSince I have been away (it’s been 8 months) we only communicate via text. He has never called me- I always have to call him. I’ve pointed this out to him and he just never made any attempts, so I’ve quit trying to call him. In the last few months our texting has become very sporadic- he will usually text me in the morning, I’ll respond when I get a chance at work, and then I won’t hear back for hours until the evening. On average we probably exchange like 4-6 messages a day. Surface level stuff. \n\nIn the last three months he will go entire weekends without texting me, at least 2-3 times a month. After the second month of this I called him and told him if there was an issue I’d rather he tell me instead of ignoring me. He insisted there was no reason and he was “just being lazy”. I told him I don’t like it and feel like we barely talk as it is and he said he’s work on it. In the meantime I hear from our mutual friends that he’s been telling everyone how he wants to get a house of his own so I’ll come back and we can live together. I just don’t understand how he possibly thinks that’s the issue here!\n\nWell this month he’s done it again. Barely speaking through the week and this weekend he hasn’t replied in three days. But he’s been active on social media so I’m definitely being ignored. \n\nI’m honestly at the end of my rope- this does not feel like a relationship anymore. At this point I’m tempted to just wait til he texts me back with some excuse and just explain over text that I feel our relationship is over. Do I suck for feeling like I shouldn’t have to call him to break up, since he hasn’t bothered to ever call me? \n\nTL;DR- long distance “relationship” consists of my being ignored for multiple days on end, but bf refuses to consider breaking up when asked prior.

This is a little bit of a complicated situation. Some basic background here- I (26F) moved out of state (in the US) about 8 months ago. At the time I had been with my boyfriend (25M) for a little over a year. We have now been together for a little over 2 years. </p>\n\n<p>Some info on my reasons for moving- financial and family. the lease on my apartment in my home state wasn’t renewed and I had 60 days to move out. When this happened I knew I wasn’t going to be able to afford to stay in my home state, as I was living paycheck to paycheck and had no way to pay for a deposit on a new apartment that would certainly be higher rent. In the months prior to this incident my parents had already been planning to move out of state back to their home state, to be closer to my grandparents who are elderly and not doing well health wise. My parents offered for me to move with them and would pay my plane ticket and moving costs. Since I couldn’t afford to stay it seemed like the best option, and I did want to be closer to my grandparents since they aren’t well. </p>\n\n<p>My boyfriend knew this and did not offer for us to try and find a place together (we live separately) until a week before I was already scheduled to move out of state. He got mad at the fact that I told him no, but at that point I already had a plane ticket and all my stuff was on the moving truck, and my car was already on its way to my new state. </p>\n\n<p>I told him when I decided my only option was to move, that if he did not want to do long distance I understood. I stressed to him that it would be very difficult to maintain a long distance relationship even with perfect daily communication. He insisted he didn’t want to break up and that he would “wait for me” to come back. He promised to come visit for my birthday and just never did. Never brought it up again either. </p>\n\n<p>Since I have been away (it’s been 8 months) we only communicate via text. He has never called me- I always have to call him. I’ve pointed this out to him and he just never made any attempts, so I’ve quit trying to call him. In the last few months our texting has become very sporadic- he will usually text me in the morning, I’ll respond when I get a chance at work, and then I won’t hear back for hours until the evening. On average we probably exchange like 4-6 messages a day. Surface level stuff. </p>\n\n<p>In the last three months he will go entire weekends without texting me, at least 2-3 times a month. After the second month of this I called him and told him if there was an issue I’d rather he tell me instead of ignoring me. He insisted there was no reason and he was “just being lazy”. I told him I don’t like it and feel like we barely talk as it is and he said he’s work on it. In the meantime I hear from our mutual friends that he’s been telling everyone how he wants to get a house of his own so I’ll come back and we can live together. I just don’t understand how he possibly thinks that’s the issue here!</p>\n\n<p>Well this month he’s done it again. Barely speaking through the week and this weekend he hasn’t replied in three days. But he’s been active on social media so I’m definitely being ignored. </p>\n\n<p>I’m honestly at the end of my rope- this does not feel like a relationship anymore. At this point I’m tempted to just wait til he texts me back with some excuse and just explain over text that I feel our relationship is over. Do I suck for feeling like I shouldn’t have to call him to break up, since he hasn’t bothered to ever call me? </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR- long distance “relationship” consists of my being ignored for multiple days on end, but bf refuses to consider breaking up when asked prior. Am I wrong for wanting to end it via text?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fczhhz","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"lizifer93","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":13,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fczhhz/i_26f_havent_heard_from_my_long_distance/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fczhhz/i_26f_havent_heard_from_my_long_distance/","subreddit_subscribers":2795065,"created_utc":1583262014,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"My girlfriend (F14) and I (M15) have been in a relationship for almost four months now and everything feels like it's going well other than one small thing.

Apologies in advance for how verbose I imagine I’ll be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year now, just a month or two shy. I love him dearly and really value our relationship. He is the smartest person I know, endlessly gracious and patient, deliberately affectionate and considerate, so understanding and so compassionate. I adore his family, his friends, our shared community, and feel very much like I belong and am welcomed in his life. Our politics are meaningfully compatible and we not only share a faith, but are shockingly well-matched in our respective levels of piety. Our relationship has provided me with a love I didn’t know existed and has helped me learn so much about what I deserve/want/expect in a partner and where to look for it. I have been very happy, happier than I’ve ever felt in a romantic relationship before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe past six or so months, however, have come with some issues. He is unemployed and he is not in school. He was working over the summer when we began dating, and he has been enrolled in university before but has been on a sabbatical since before our relationship began. I was under the impression that new, steady employment and/or schooling were on his radar when we began our relationship and that I could expect to see one or both within a few months. It has, obviously, been several. He is brilliant and more than capable at accomplishing whatever he might like to pursue, and I know for certain his university is itching to have him back, and that the process would be much simpler and quicker than he imagines. It is frustrating to me to know how much is within his reach, much more than I’ve ever had access to, and to watch him refuse to claim it, to feel unworthy of it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know he struggles with anxiety and major depressive. I do, too, and have been in his position before, finding myself unable to just get out of my head and get my shit together, even when my relationship depends on it, even when my own quality of life depends on it. I have tried to keep this in mind when approaching him about it, to remain calm and compassionate in spite of how much difficulty I’m having with it. I know he’s no happier with the situation than I am, but, I have to be honest about how this is impacting my life and take that seriously, and it doesn’t look good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor starters, six months is a long time to have nothing going on. Again, I get it, I really do, especially considering that when I first moved to this city (where he lives), it took me three months to find work of my own. I am making up for it now by doing some difficult but high-paying shift work, and was able to remain fairly comfortable in the interim because of my savings and my planning for the worst. Six months is made much longer, too, considering that it makes up half of our relationship, and that fact and its connotations are certainly not lost on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, it is starting to really affect how I feel about him. I am obviously frustrated with him, but I am, more specifically, starting to lose my attraction to him. While our sex life was incredible during the beginning of our relationship, we now go weeks if not months without sleeping together. I cannot find it in myself to get in the mood while he does so little but sit around all day. His hygiene has been suffering, too, which doesn’t surprise me given his current state of mind, but I believe it is equally understandable that I do not want to have sex with a partner who has not showered in weeks, whose clothing is falling apart, who takes no pride in his appearance. His libido has remained the same in spite of all this and I just can’t match it, nor do I want to when I don’t feel he's paying himself and his body the respect he deserves. I am honestly kind of grossed out a lot of the time. I desperately don’t want him to feel like I don’t love him or am not attracted to him anymore, and, while I am bathed and well-groomed, it is well within my rights to expect the most basic level of adult human cleanliness from whomever wants me to sleep with them. I hate to admit it, but it is also sometimes difficult to feel even warmly, much less \\~\\~sexy\\~\\~ towards him when I know I've been busting my ass all week and he's been doing... nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt’s becoming more and more difficult for us to relate to one another, too. He seems shocked that I’m as tired as I am after work, sometimes even offended that I need the quiet and solitude that I do after working hard all day. Work is going well, too, so I’ve been planning some travel for myself, spending a little money on a few nice things, taking good care of myself and finding pleasure in it, starting to feel excited about my next five years. While I am still able to relate to him and what he has (or doesn’t have) going on, he is losing his ability to relate to me. I would love to take him along with me in this feeling and this future, to eventually get married and have children as we both want, but the distance between us and our respective positions in life is gradually increasing and he doesn’t seem concerned about or even aware of it, which makes me so sad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly in this non-exhaustive post, perhaps my least-justified but most upsetting feeling here is that he just doesn’t respect me. I had told him at the end of last year, pretty gravely after many other discussions about this, that I would feel much happier and more secure in our relationship if he found a job or re-enrolled in school by the beginning of January. Clearly, he did not. After so much discussion about this (and yes, we’ve done a lot of talking), he knows how I feel and how our relationship is affecting my life. I wonder if he doesn’t believe me because I don’t lose my shit on him about it, don’t nag him, don’t yell or cry or hand out ultimatums. I have never had any luck in previous relationships trying to exert control like that and it’s certainly not kind to whoever’s on the receiving end so I’ve abandoned any hint of that attitude completely. However, I am open and emotionally-expressive, careful with my words and intent on being understood, so I can’t imagine throwing a fit could make him understand anything any better than he already does. Although I know how stuck he feels, it is difficult for me to not feel that he just doesn’t care about my boundaries, limits, and expectations when he is doing literally nothing, however small, differently. Especially when his only contribution in these discussions is “I’ll get it done” followed by precisely zero behavioral changes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know the drill. I’m going to be out of here in three or four months, tops, if we stay on this path. It’ll break my heart to lose him, his parents, our church, all the beautiful pieces of our relationship, all the happiness he’s given me. But I’m young and tough enough and I’ll live, and I am willing to break my own heart in order to move on healthier and happier. But tell me, please, is there something I’m missing? Is there a secret method to help someone you love get their ass in gear and feel better? I know I cannot be responsible for his life and health, and I have no interest in being a “cure”. But I do wonder if there’s some way I can do more, something I can do or something more I can say to help, to be believed, to inspire some positive change. If there’s a perspective I’m missing, some insight I could use, maybe even an asskicking of my own. If not, I am just grateful for the space to vent.

If there’s a perspective I’m missing, some insight I could use, maybe even an asskicking of my own. If not, I am just grateful for the space to vent.

It was a distance relationship as I was still attending college and he was 4 hours away working. My last semester of my undergrad, I had to take a science class and lab.

We got each other’s numbers and Snapchat that night and became very close friends after that. We both knew we had feelings for each other; there was no denying the sexual tension between us.

I made him feel capable of falling in love again. Capable of passion. Capable of romance. \n\nBut it’s difficult. I can’t understand his situation with his memory loss because I’ve never experienced anything like that. I feel bad because I can’t connect with him on that level. However, I am empathetic.
