All morning, S and I were texting about general stuff and how excited she was for the social. She left to go help set up around 12, so our conversation ended there. I texted her something around 4, which she didn’t reply to (never did) but I figured she was just busy setting up and didn’t think about it.\n\nWe get there and she says Hi and hugs everyone except for me. I tried to talk to her throughout the night but she just brushed me off and was “too busy” taking care of everything and had no time, but could easily find time to talk to everyone else, dance and have fun. One of my friends who is really good friends with her said I should ask S to dance, and when I said she probably wouldn’t she told me “you’d be surprised.” I see S passing by on the dance floor and when I ask her all she says is “No, I can’t” and a walks away.

This has happened on multiple occasions, and I don’t know how I should bring it up or if I should just stop talking to her at this point.\n\nAs far as I know from what multiple friends told me, S used to have a crush on me when I was in a relationship. My ex and I broke up, and over time I started to develop feelings for S. When I tried to make a move she told me she only saw me as a friend, and I was completely okay with it.

She’s not a bad friend, but just in a group setting when this happens I’m always left feeling confused and I’m not sure how I should bring it up when she acts like everything is fine after.\n\nTLDR; I talk to friend every day, things are great when we hang out but in a group setting she blows me off and barely talks to me.

Before we got married, it just seemed like he had poor time management skills. But now that we're married and we live together, it seems like at best he has poor time management skills and at worst he just doesn't want to be around me.\n\nI'll start by saying that I don't need to know exactly where my husband is every second of every day but that I would appreciate knowing like a loose itinerary of his plans for the day/night - what he's doing, about what time he'll be home, call/text if anything changes. At first, he would give me his plans but then he'd never stick to them. It's gotten to the point where he won't give me his plans and when I asked why he said \"Because then you expect me to stick to them and you get mad when I don't.\"\n\nI guess I'll give an example of how this typically goes. (He does home renovations with another guy.) He'll go to work and he tells me that he'll be done around 4. By 5, I haven't heard from him so I text him and he says that he's gone to grab some pizza with the guy he works with, they're just finishing up, he's leaving in ten minutes. Now it's 7, still no sign of husband. I call and he says that after pizza they went to Home Depot to get some supplies for the next day and while they're there they get talking to someone they know and he's lost track of time but he's leaving soon. Now it's 8, he's still not home. I call again, he's at a friend's house watching a hockey game. \n\nThis is where the disagreement starts. By this time, I'm mad because he said he was coming home \"around four\" but now it's four hours later and he's still not home. I'm mad that I have to keep calling and asking where he is and that he can't just text or call to say \"hey, grabbing pizza after work!\" or something. He's mad that I keep calling to find out where he is and views this as controlling and almost always by this point he says \"I NEVER bother you when you're out with your friends, but no you keep calling and won't let me have a good time.\" My answer to that is that I tell him in advance what my plans are and that's not even why I'm mad.\n\nAnother layer to this is that we're on a really tight budget and for the most part have given up on going out so I'm frustrated that a) by going for pizza and driving all over he's spending money that we don't really have and b) that if he really wants to go out, why can't we do something together with the little money we have?\n\nThe times that we have managed to have the \"well why didn't you text/call when your plans changed?\" conversation, he always has an excuse. \"My phone was in the car charging\" or \"I was busy talking to someone.\" Like, I don't think it would be that rude to say, \"Excuse me, let me text my wife real quick.\"\n\nEvery time we try to have this conversation, I try to emphasize that I'm mad that he doesn't communicate with me. But he just says that I'm being controlling and if I try to explain my point again, he says that I'm just repeating myself and we're going in circles.\n\nTLDR: My husband things that plans are a flexible thing and I don't so when he changes his plans on a whim and then I call to see where he is, he says that I'm being controlling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Am I being too controlling?

Before we got married, it just seemed like he had poor time management skills. But now that we&#39;re married and we live together, it seems like at best he has poor time management skills and at worst he just doesn&#39;t want to be around me.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll start by saying that I don&#39;t need to know exactly where my husband is every second of every day but that I would appreciate knowing like a loose itinerary of his plans for the day/night - what he&#39;s doing, about what time he&#39;ll be home, call/text if anything changes. At first, he would give me his plans but then he&#39;d never stick to them. It&#39;s gotten to the point where he won&#39;t give me his plans and when I asked why he said &quot;Because then you expect me to stick to them and you get mad when I don&#39;t.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I guess I&#39;ll give an example of how this typically goes. (He does home renovations with another guy.) He&#39;ll go to work and he tells me that he&#39;ll be done around 4. By 5, I haven&#39;t heard from him so I text him and he says that he&#39;s gone to grab some pizza with the guy he works with, they&#39;re just finishing up, he&#39;s leaving in ten minutes. Now it&#39;s 7, still no sign of husband. I call and he says that after pizza they went to Home Depot to get some supplies for the next day and while they&#39;re there they get talking to someone they know and he&#39;s lost track of time but he&#39;s leaving soon. Now it&#39;s 8, he&#39;s still not home. I call again, he&#39;s at a friend&#39;s house watching a hockey game. </p>\n\n<p>This is where the disagreement starts. By this time, I&#39;m mad because he said he was coming home &quot;around four&quot; but now it&#39;s four hours later and he&#39;s still not home. I&#39;m mad that I have to keep calling and asking where he is and that he can&#39;t just text or call to say &quot;hey, grabbing pizza after work!&quot; or something. He&#39;s mad that I keep calling to find out where he is and views this as controlling and almost always by this point he says &quot;I NEVER bother you when you&#39;re out with your friends, but no you keep calling and won&#39;t let me have a good time.&quot; My answer to that is that I tell him in advance what my plans are and that&#39;s not even why I&#39;m mad.</p>\n\n<p>Another layer to this is that we&#39;re on a really tight budget and for the most part have given up on going out so I&#39;m frustrated that a) by going for pizza and driving all over he&#39;s spending money that we don&#39;t really have and b) that if he really wants to go out, why can&#39;t we do something together with the little money we have?</p>\n\n<p>The times that we have managed to have the &quot;well why didn&#39;t you text/call when your plans changed?&quot; conversation, he always has an excuse. &quot;My phone was in the car charging&quot; or &quot;I was busy talking to someone.&quot; Like, I don&#39;t think it would be that rude to say, &quot;Excuse me, let me text my wife real quick.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Every time we try to have this conversation, I try to emphasize that I&#39;m mad that he doesn&#39;t communicate with me. But he just says that I&#39;m being controlling and if I try to explain my point again, he says that I&#39;m just repeating myself and we&#39;re going in circles.</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: My husband things that plans are a flexible thing and I don&#39;t so when he changes his plans on a whim and then I call to see where he is, he says that I&#39;m being controlling.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>- Am I being too controlling? Is checking in once an hour after a time that he said he&#39;d be home too much?</p>\n\n<p>- I&#39;m really not good with translating feelings to words. It took me nearly two hours to type this.

I told him that I really appreciate the things he has given me, but it just feels strange that he has an entire fund dedicated to buying me stuff.\n\nHe tells me he feels kind of bad that we could never go on \"better\" dates or give each other \"nice\" stuff before and he wants to make up for that a bit.

This was my worst fear before i ended things and it has manifested into a reality. Please help.\n\nI was with my wife for nearly 10 years, when I met her she was a recovering hardcore heroin addict. During our relationship she was sober for nearly the entire time, she did great, even being able to take limited pain meds around 5 years in after a surgery without relapsing or waking up that demon (although it did scare the shit out of me at the time)\n\nAround 3 years ago, we both tried kratom hearing it was kind of like kava which we enjoyed and found it too similar to opiates and we agreed not to use it anymore so as not to keep playing with fire. She had been seeing a therapist to deal with a childhood steeped in terrible traumas and had convinced her therapist she was doing so well her therapist suggested she didn't need therapy anymore unless she really wanted it.\n\nUnknown to me and the therapist, she was using it a LOT but hiding it and lying to her therapist for xanax, mixing the two, and eventually crashed her car a couple times, telling me each time she swerved to avoid a deer. I was an idiot and I believed it until I found a ton of empty pill and kratom bottles in her car. There was a major fight and loss of trust, after lots of communication i agreed to let her try and build that trust back and I felt guilty for trying the kratom with her to begin with so i feel i shared some of the blame. I told her I would cover all bills and she should start saving all of her money towards a deposit on an apartment (she never did) in case this happened again because we wouldn't survive and I wouldn't have someone stealing from me and lying to me living in my house.\n\n\n\nAnyway that didn't happen, the lying continued, manipulation, got worse, it came to a head and I decided as much as I love her I could not continue that marriage or start a family with that kind of situation and called it quits. It was very painful for both of us but moreso for her I think. She couldn't keep a job for one reason or another. Was staying with neighbors for a while but the father became creepy towards her and she left and started living in her car. She got high or drunk and totaled her car shortly after, injuring herself. I could not stand the idea of this beautiful person having to go sleep by herself in the park and being around triggering influences. I met with her, a while after that, she seemed healthy and stable, and I sold her a newer car for $500 so she would have a place to stay at least.\n\n\n\nFast forward to now, the car has been parked in front of what looks like a stereotypical tweaker house for around 2 months. I never dug because I didn't want to know the answer as to what the situation was but I'd try and email her (she doesn't have a cell phone and wouldn't take one that I offered her) to see how she was doing from time to time.\n\n\n\nSomeone in this small town told me she was running around with this old ex-con tweaker who she had worked with. Well I finally did some digging and he has a criminal history with everything from attempted murder, child molestation, domestic violence, possession and sale of meth/hypodermic needles, burglaries, gun charges, you name it. They love all of each others posts on facebook, and his address is listed as the same run down house her car has been parked in front of. Yesterday, after trying to get in touch with her for weeks to see how she has been doing and if the job search is going well she sends me this,\n\n\n\n\n*\"Hi. I'm sorry I'm so fucked up. I can't stand my life. the cafe didn't work out. My boss sexually harassed me and after saying something he didn't stop so I quit. I can't do this anymore I'm not ok at all and I'm going through a lot. I need to not be here. I'll probably die here. This is a go no where town and I feel like I'm already dying. I've been sick and had nothing good to tell you. I'm alive and the dogs are good but that's all. I'm so sorry i ruined everything''**\n\n\n\nSo I'm at a loss of what to do. I thought the worst part was the divorce, didn't think I could feel worse, I always worried about a situation like this arising and was told \"you can't blame yourself if she makes those choices\" but I honestly can't internalize that. She made shitty choices and became a person who I couldn't be married to but I don't completely blame her, her entire childhood was trauma and she never had anything better. I also feel guilt for even trying kratom with her in the first place. I don't know how to help. I'm engulfed in horror. I'm thinking about asking the police to do a standby while I go and knock on the door, but worried about making things worse if her situation is abusive.\n\n\n\n\nI have no # for her, and she only checks her email maybe once or twice a month. She has no contact with her family as they are all horrible people. I'm terrified and helpless and guilt ridden about the fact that if I had stayed with her she would likely not be in this situation. Would I be happy? No. but my happiness would not be as bad of a penalty has her actual death or an abusive situation. If she dies it will fucking break me for the rest of my life.\n\nTL;DR My ex wife of 10 years is in a situation she may not survive and I have no clue how to help or what to do.\n\nWhat do I do?

My original post was about an insecurity I was having about not feeling like I had an adequate amount of attention from my partner (27M). That resulted in making me feel invisible, needy, unnoticed, crazy, list goes on. In short, my partner and I definitely check in with each other and communicate much less than your average couple. This created a problem in our relationship and made me feel very insecure. \n\nFirst of all, shout out to u/TheBrambs for their advice: “Before you convince yourself your crazy, flawed, and in need of a personality transplant - have you considered that maybe as you've aged and gotten more dating experience your tastes have tended towards a more involved and communicative partner? That doesn't make you mentally ill, I would say most healthy relationships have a higher degree of casual communication and checking-in than what you've described.”\n\nSo now for the update. As predicted by commenters in the original thread, the problem got worse before it got better. I had a really great conversation with my partner on Sunday and he asked me directly, what can we change to make things better for us? And this is what we decided: \n1.) I asked him to put in a little more effort checking in when we are away from each other. One small change is just a quick text every morning when we are away from each other. We don’t need to be glued to our phones the entire day and I certainly don’t expect him to be. In my job, I work with people so it’s actually impossible for me to reply to texts all day long and I also like to ditch my phone. He said this was totally reasonable and asked me to be patient when he messes up or forgets, or is unable to reach out in a weird scenario like his phone not being charged overnight. So far he’s kept his promise every day this week and I’ve been really appreciative and grateful. It’s so nice to see he’s trying. \n2.) He asked me to remind myself anytime I’m feeling anxious and am starting to snowball, that he loves me and cares about me no matter what negative thoughts I’m having when we are away from each other. He held me close and told me to freeze this memory of him telling me this and honestly it might sound stupid but this also has helped a lot and made me feel much more secure. I’m going to try my best to hang on to this. \n3.) He told me if I have not heard from him at all during the day or the evening, and I want to see him, his door is always open and I am always welcome to come over and see him and that he would love a surprise visit anytime (which honestly, probably won’t happen often but I’m so happy this is an option). He asked if it was ok for him to surprise me with a visit too and I said of course. \n4.) He asked me to be even more direct in the plainest of plain English about what my needs are and what I want in our relationship. I can’t let myself feel embarrassed about what my needs are and hide them in metaphors, because he won’t be able to deliver on his end. And he really does want to deliver! \n\nLast night before we went to bed I told him that I loved him a lot and I know he is a great boyfriend and that he makes me very happy, and that any riffs we have I know are not malicious. I wanted to make sure he knows how appreciated he is and that the effort doesn’t go unnoticed and I think that made him really happy. \n\nI have a pretty busy schedule during the week and fill my plans up with other friends a lot. I’m feeling good and am enjoying my time away from my partner much more and have been able to focus on enjoying the present moment as a result of these changes and comprises. \n\nTL;DR my partner and I have different relationship needs and it was causing some problems in our relationship.

I tried a little bit on my 18th birthday (legal drinking age here is 18) and haven't had another drop since. All my friends know it and I usually end up drinking something non-alcoholic if I'm at a bar with someone. This particular group of friends has known this since day one.\n\n  \nA few weeks ago me and my high school home group were catching up over drinks at a bar. The 6 of us are quite a close group and have been getting lunch or something every few months since school ended a few years ago. Our home group teacher is only a few years older than us so she actually joins us too.\n\nWhat happened this last time really upset me, we were all catching up over drinks when I excused myself to the bathroom for 2 minutes. After I came back I could tell within the first sip that there was alcohol in my drink, I confronted the group and they all admitted to slipping some vodka into my drink as a \"fun prank\" while I was gone. Everyone was in on it (including the teacher). I'm guessing they thought it would be funny as I don't normally drink.\n\nI was absolutely furious, I didn't try to make a scene but I got up and left immediately (as discreetly as possible). A couple of them changed their tone completely and tried apologising as I was leaving. I've been receiving various apologies and explanations but I've just been ignoring them.\n\nSince then I've been receiving pressure from other mutual friends saying it's wrong of me to abandon friendships for something so minor. Others (and also people from the group of 6) are saying stuff like \"everyone drinks alcohol\" and it's \"no big deal\".\n\nI honestly cannot believe what I'm hearing, how the hell is \"everyone drinks alcohol\" a justification?\n\nI don't want to lose friends but also I don't want to be in contact with people who have such little respect for my boundaries. How can I make them understand this? Should I even bother? Or am I the one in the wrong here?\n\nAny input would be appreciated, thanks in advance\n\ntl;dr Friends put alcohol in my drink as a joke.

I tried a little bit on my 18th birthday (legal drinking age here is 18) and haven&#39;t had another drop since. All my friends know it and I usually end up drinking something non-alcoholic if I&#39;m at a bar with someone. This particular group of friends has known this since day one.</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks ago me and my high school home group were catching up over drinks at a bar. The 6 of us are quite a close group and have been getting lunch or something every few months since school ended a few years ago. Our home group teacher is only a few years older than us so she actually joins us too.</p>\n\n<p>What happened this last time really upset me, we were all catching up over drinks when I excused myself to the bathroom for 2 minutes. After I came back I could tell within the first sip that there was alcohol in my drink, I confronted the group and they all admitted to slipping some vodka into my drink as a &quot;fun prank&quot; while I was gone. Everyone was in on it (including the teacher). I&#39;m guessing they thought it would be funny as I don&#39;t normally drink.</p>\n\n<p>I was absolutely furious, I didn&#39;t try to make a scene but I got up and left immediately (as discreetly as possible). A couple of them changed their tone completely and tried apologising as I was leaving. I&#39;ve been receiving various apologies and explanations but I&#39;ve just been ignoring them.</p>\n\n<p>Since then I&#39;ve been receiving pressure from other mutual friends saying it&#39;s wrong of me to abandon friendships for something so minor. Others (and also people from the group of 6) are saying stuff like &quot;everyone drinks alcohol&quot; and it&#39;s &quot;no big deal&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I honestly cannot believe what I&#39;m hearing, how the hell is &quot;everyone drinks alcohol&quot; a justification?</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t want to lose friends but also I don&#39;t want to be in contact with people who have such little respect for my boundaries. How can I make them understand this? Should I even bother? Or am I the one in the wrong here?</p>\n\n<p>Any input would be appreciated, thanks in advance</p>\n\n<p>tl;dr Friends put alcohol in my drink as a joke.

Went out to dinner and my father did not ask for anything and is somehow holding down a job. He seems very senile and I'm not sure he's in good health, but he claims he will make it to the wedding despite me trying to make it seem like it's not a big deal and we're just doing something small. I feel, somehow, worse, so I think I'm gonna go to bed, but thanks for all of the advice.\n\n\nHi all - I need help handling this situation and understanding if I am genuinely in the wrong here, and need perspective from outside my family. I am being purposely vague here about ages and locations to avoid identification. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nRelevant background: I am one of 4 siblings, the one in the title we'll call A (40sM), as well as S (30sF) and D (30sM). Our father was very abusive to our mother (physically, emotionally, financially, what have you) and often verbally abusive to us. While he was, by any standard, a horrible father and husband, he was also what many people would consider a good person outside of the home, and was a political activist in our home country that made a lot of important impacts for a very disadvantaged group of people. He never held official political office (he tried and failed more than once to be elected) but he was on a first name basis with many high ranking political officials, including the PM at the time. If you google him there are articles talking about the movement he was a part of and how important his work was. This is impressive because (and again, I swear this is relevant), he came from absolutely nothing, didn't make it past the 4th grade, and spent his childhood either on the streets or being mercilessly beaten by police officers or teachers, people he was supposed to trust. Genuinely, I feel a lot of sympathy for my father and I think he could have done a lot of good if he had come from a different background and didn't have the psychological issues that he has as a result of his upbringing.\nWe all have strained relationships with our father, D is not on speaking terms with him at all for reasons that are very justified. A has a good relationship with him and sees him often (he has a very forgiving and sympathetic personality). D and I live in the US while A, S, and my father, live in our home country. I only really speak to my dad on birthdays or when something relevant happens (i.e. when my paternal grandmother passed away). It took me months to even tell him I was engaged. \nIt's worth noting that out of all of my siblings, I had it the best (and I still have CPTSD, so I mean the best is relative). I was shielded from seeing a lot of the violence (though certainly not from hearing it), while A, for example, had to stand between my father and my mother to stop him from stabbing her. My mother also had more ability to get away from my father when I was growing up, at least for short periods of time, which spared me from a lot. She finally was able to divorce him when I was 18. We all have a good relationship with my mother who I believe tried her best (there was always some resentment towards her for not leaving my father sooner but that's something we have all more or less worked past at this point). \n\nAnyways here's the situation at hand: I am getting married in the US in about 6 months and I am currently visiting my home country. My father has asked me to dinner tonight and I have been tipped off by more than one person that he will more than likely ask me to buy him a plane ticket to come to my wedding as he does not have much money (his activism career certainly didn't pay much and he has never held down a stable job as long as I can remember). It took me awhile to even tell him I was engaged because I don't really want him to be at the wedding, but I told him because I did not want him to be hurt by finding out from someone else. I still hope he doesn't show up but I will invite him and whatever happens happens, but I don't want to help him get there despite being able to afford it. If he asks, I plan on telling him I don't have the money (he does not know how much I make so has no reason to not believe me) and letting him know I won't be hurt if he cannot make it as it will most likely be a casual wedding anyways. I have told both A and S to refuse to help him with a plane ticket (S would have refused regardless, and I don't think A could afford it even if he wanted to as he has a wife and 3 children to buy tickets for).\n\nA and I were talking yesterday and he proceeded to guilt me saying that I would regret not having my father there, that even though she never did so intentionally, my mother has poisoned us against him, and it is unfair for me to punish him for his actions because his upbringing ruined any chance he had of being a normal father and husband, and all things considered he wasn't that bad to me and did a lot of good for a lot of people. Going on about how if I was going to hold my father accountable then I should hold my mother accountable for not leaving despite having multiple opportunities to do so (I don't think he honestly means that, he loves my mother very much, I think he just wanted to say it for the sake of comparison). And if he could forgive him then why can't I? I explained to him that I was working through my issues with dad in therapy, and trying to read about all the good he did to help me have a better image of him in my head and want a better relationship with him, but I don't think there is enough therapy between now and my wedding (and honestly, ever) to make me want to have him there (and also, forget about just me, he often gets very drunk at events like this and causes discomfort for a lot of people).\n\nIt honestly spoiled my whole mood for the day but it has me feeling bad and questioning if I am in the wrong.

Went out to dinner and my father did not ask for anything and is somehow holding down a job. He seems very senile and I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s in good health, but he claims he will make it to the wedding despite me trying to make it seem like it&#39;s not a big deal and we&#39;re just doing something small. I feel, somehow, worse, so I think I&#39;m gonna go to bed, but thanks for all of the advice.</p>\n\n<p>Hi all - I need help handling this situation and understanding if I am genuinely in the wrong here, and need perspective from outside my family. I am being purposely vague here about ages and locations to avoid identification. TLDR at the bottom.</p>\n\n<p>Relevant background: I am one of 4 siblings, the one in the title we&#39;ll call A (40sM), as well as S (30sF) and D (30sM). Our father was very abusive to our mother (physically, emotionally, financially, what have you) and often verbally abusive to us. While he was, by any standard, a horrible father and husband, he was also what many people would consider a good person outside of the home, and was a political activist in our home country that made a lot of important impacts for a very disadvantaged group of people. He never held official political office (he tried and failed more than once to be elected) but he was on a first name basis with many high ranking political officials, including the PM at the time. If you google him there are articles talking about the movement he was a part of and how important his work was. This is impressive because (and again, I swear this is relevant), he came from absolutely nothing, didn&#39;t make it past the 4th grade, and spent his childhood either on the streets or being mercilessly beaten by police officers or teachers, people he was supposed to trust. Genuinely, I feel a lot of sympathy for my father and I think he could have done a lot of good if he had come from a different background and didn&#39;t have the psychological issues that he has as a result of his upbringing.\nWe all have strained relationships with our father, D is not on speaking terms with him at all for reasons that are very justified. A has a good relationship with him and sees him often (he has a very forgiving and sympathetic personality). D and I live in the US while A, S, and my father, live in our home country. I only really speak to my dad on birthdays or when something relevant happens (i.e. when my paternal grandmother passed away). It took me months to even tell him I was engaged. \nIt&#39;s worth noting that out of all of my siblings, I had it the best (and I still have CPTSD, so I mean the best is relative). I was shielded from seeing a lot of the violence (though certainly not from hearing it), while A, for example, had to stand between my father and my mother to stop him from stabbing her. My mother also had more ability to get away from my father when I was growing up, at least for short periods of time, which spared me from a lot. She finally was able to divorce him when I was 18. We all have a good relationship with my mother who I believe tried her best (there was always some resentment towards her for not leaving my father sooner but that&#39;s something we have all more or less worked past at this point). </p>\n\n<p>Anyways here&#39;s the situation at hand: I am getting married in the US in about 6 months and I am currently visiting my home country. My father has asked me to dinner tonight and I have been tipped off by more than one person that he will more than likely ask me to buy him a plane ticket to come to my wedding as he does not have much money (his activism career certainly didn&#39;t pay much and he has never held down a stable job as long as I can remember). It took me awhile to even tell him I was engaged because I don&#39;t really want him to be at the wedding, but I told him because I did not want him to be hurt by finding out from someone else. I still hope he doesn&#39;t show up but I will invite him and whatever happens happens, but I don&#39;t want to help him get there despite being able to afford it. If he asks, I plan on telling him I don&#39;t have the money (he does not know how much I make so has no reason to not believe me) and letting him know I won&#39;t be hurt if he cannot make it as it will most likely be a casual wedding anyways. I have told both A and S to refuse to help him with a plane ticket (S would have refused regardless, and I don&#39;t think A could afford it even if he wanted to as he has a wife and 3 children to buy tickets for).</p>\n\n<p>A and I were talking yesterday and he proceeded to guilt me saying that I would regret not having my father there, that even though she never did so intentionally, my mother has poisoned us against him, and it is unfair for me to punish him for his actions because his upbringing ruined any chance he had of being a normal father and husband, and all things considered he wasn&#39;t that bad to me and did a lot of good for a lot of people. Going on about how if I was going to hold my father accountable then I should hold my mother accountable for not leaving despite having multiple opportunities to do so (I don&#39;t think he honestly means that, he loves my mother very much, I think he just wanted to say it for the sake of comparison). And if he could forgive him then why can&#39;t I? I explained to him that I was working through my issues with dad in therapy, and trying to read about all the good he did to help me have a better image of him in my head and want a better relationship with him, but I don&#39;t think there is enough therapy between now and my wedding (and honestly, ever) to make me want to have him there (and also, forget about just me, he often gets very drunk at events like this and causes discomfort for a lot of people).</p>\n\n<p>It honestly spoiled my whole mood for the day but it has me feeling bad and questioning if I am in the wrong. S is livid that A would say those things to me and said she would talk to him, my mother thinks A is right but it is up to me to decide what to do (I obviously did not tell her what A said about her as she would be very hurt).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading all of this, I am looking for advice on how to handle the situation with A if he brings it up again, and also if there is a better way to handle my father asking for money without hurting him. Also, if anyone has ever not had their abusive father at their wedding and regretted it, I&#39;d love to hear your perspective. </p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR I am being guilted for not wanting to buy my abusive (but generally a good person) father a plane ticket to come to the US for my wedding.

My mom does play favorites (she&#39;s more engaged when she&#39;s talking with me and wilk often just brush my sister off, but she still takes care of money/food/extracurriculars and that) but I feel like it would be weird to take care of a child for ten years and never offer adoption? My sister and I are in a similar situation legally- neither of us are liable to go back to our birth families to say the least, so it isn&#39;t that it would be harder to adopt my sister than me.</p>\n\n<p>I personally don&#39;t feel right getting adopted by our mom before my sister and it really doesn&#39;t feel fair. My sister wants me to agree to the adoption to make things easier for me, but I definitely don&#39;t want to be adopted without my sister.</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR my foster mom offered to adopt me, but has never brought adoption up to my sister and I don&#39;t want to get adopted without my sister, and now I want to rescind my acceptance unless my sister also gets adopted. I don&#39;t know what to do.</strong></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"0dcfde48-cb01-11e2-bb61-12313d14782d","can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fcnft1","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"bananasfosterthroway","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":32,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fcnft1/my_15m_foster_mother_40sf_wants_to_adopt_me_but/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fcnft1/my_15m_foster_mother_40sf_wants_to_adopt_me_but/","subreddit_subscribers":2795086,"created_utc":1583201503,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},"fcuwcn":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"My girlfriend explained to me that she had gone on a few dates with this guy that she’s known for a very long time, back in November/December.

It got to me too, hell, I still choke up about it sometimes. But it&#39;s been years. My father just seemingly chooses not to do anything to help pull our lives back together.</p>\n\n<p>I love him and my sister with all of my heart, I do. I&#39;d kill for them if I had to, and I know he loves us too. But it feels like my father just isn&#39;t doing anything, and it makes me feel so overwhelmed and frustrated. I&#39;m growing resentful and I don&#39;t think I can (or should) do this alone. I definitely feel alone. How do I approach my father about this, without seeming &quot;rude&quot; or &quot;disrespectful&quot; as I fear he&#39;ll call me?</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR - My mother, the breadwinner, died a few years ago and nothing has been the same since. My dad only plays video games all the time, I feel like I&#39;m doing everything in the family and I&#39;m starting to resent him for not doing anything. How do I talk to him about this without him getting incredibly angry at me?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT : I would like to add that we&#39;re outside of the US. It&#39;s one of my goals to get us out and move there. CPS wouldn&#39;t do much of anything, they&#39;d probably consider us in much better living conditions than other children in this third world country. My father isn&#39;t a <em>complete</em> mess, he helps do some things around the house and lately I finally got him to cover certain subjects within my sister&#39;s homeschooling and we&#39;re working together to try and get some more income online. However, I still have to basically nag him to get things done and I just feel like he can do better.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"0dcfde48-cb01-11e2-bb61-12313d14782d","can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fcw7cz","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Jellybabiesplease","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":29,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fcw7cz/my_widowed_dad_m51_isnt_doing_anything_and_im_f17/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fcw7cz/my_widowed_dad_m51_isnt_doing_anything_and_im_f17/","subreddit_subscribers":2795086,"created_utc":1583249427,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},"fen6r8":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"Throwaway for obvious reasons. My [23F] sister [25F] is getting married to her boyfriend [28M] of two years in about a month. I am the matron of honor in her wedding, as I married my own husband [30M] a little over a year ago. My sister and her fiancé live about a 10-hour drive or short plane flight away from my immediate family. All of her events have been local to her, except for the bachelor/bachelorette weekend which I hosted in our hometown.\n\nBackground info that seems irrelevant but is actually material to the story: up until last month, I had chest-length blonde hair. I ended up getting a short haircut to my chin that I thought wasn’t terribly radical—basically, the least edgy short haircut a woman can have. I received very positive feedback about this haircut from everyone, including from my sister.\n\nMy sister said she’d like to have her and her fiancé’s bachelor/bachelorette weekend in our hometown, as we live in a culturally eclectic area with a vibrant nightlife. The plan was for her bridesmaids and his groomsmen to have a joint outing on Saturday morning, and then split up later to have girls/guys-only outings. She’d voiced a desire to have crawfish and go on a swamp tour as our joint outing, to introduce the bridal party to the local culture. Because my husband’s family is very experienced with boiling crawfish and I knew of a swamp tour convenient to my house, my husband and I really spearheaded planning the weekend for them and decided to host a boil at my parents’ home. We arranged for the swamp tour, decorated and prepared the house for the boil party, and boiled 175 lbs of crawfish (no small undertaking). All members of the bridal party sent us equal shares of money to help us cover these costs. My husband also drove everyone who had flown in from their hotel an hour away.\n\nAdmittedly, we were an hour later than projected bringing the crawfish to the boil party, but everyone still had ample time to eat before we went to the swamp tour. We’d been drinking all morning and brought alcoholic drinks on the boat. I’d mentioned my hair was acting crazy because of the winds from the boat ride, and she offered me a hair tie. I reminded her I couldn’t really tie up my hair anymore, as it was too short. She then replied to me, “oh, that’s right, I forgot you’d cut your hair,” before turning to her friends and mumbling something private, which was met with snickers. My husband and brother had overheard what she’d said—that I’d cut my hair right before her wedding, without permission from her—and relayed it to me. I was pretty offended, because she’d acted like she’d really liked my hair prior to this, and also because I felt it was my choice to do whatever I’d like with my hair, but I didn’t say anything.\n\nAfter the tour had ended, my husband and I returned to my parents’ house before starting the girls-only night, but I was obviously feeling dejected because my sister and her friends (who I was supposed to party with that night) had been laughing at me. I mentioned the incident to my mom, who told me that she’d overheard my sister making some unkind comments to the other bridesmaids earlier that day about our tardiness with the crawfish and my own wedding (which was an intimate, family-only affair at an Airbnb) not being a big deal like hers will be. Again, despite hearing these comments, I was still intending to be present for the festivities later that night, although begrudgingly. I went to go shower and do my makeup. While I was thus occupied, my mom (who’d had a bit to drink) texted my sister against my express wishes, saying that she hopes my sister appreciates all I’d done for her. My sister ended up calling me minutes later to figure out what all had been said, and I basically laid my feelings out for her. We ended up having a pretty heated argument on the phone—she ended up calling me a bitch, and I reminded her she hadn’t gone to the same lengths for my wedding—and she hung up on me. After that argument, my husband and I skipped the festivities to spend the night at my parents’ house.\n\nThe next morning, my brother told me that my sister had posted several passive-aggressive things on social media clearly aimed at me. He decided to call my sister and see how her night had gone, putting her on speaker phone for me and my husband to hear. My sister claimed she’d never said anything negative about me in the first place, and that my mom was manipulating the story. My brother mentioned he’d overheard her say she didn’t approve of my haircut on the boat ride, and she admitted that she didn’t like my hair and it didn’t align with her “wedding vision.” She also said that her fiancé had actually made fun of me as well by saying I look like a boy. An hour or so after this phone conversation was over, she called my brother back to tell him everyone in my immediate family was uninvited from the wedding for not being more supportive.\n\nSince that day, she and her fiancé have claimed we were never uninvited from the wedding and have attempted to contact me and my husband to apparently smooth things over, but I’m pretty upset that I was apparently a huge joke to not only my sister and my fellow bridesmaids, but also my brother-in-law-to-be. I have decided to skip the bridal shower a week from now (I will be mailing her the personalized gifts I bought them), although I will probably attend the wedding in a month. That being said, I’m not sure I’m comfortable being in the bridal party anymore and am considering dropping out.\n\n*TL;DR: my sister gossiped about my appearance at a party I’d thrown her, which ruined the bachelorette party and is making me seriously consider dropping out of the wedding*","author_fullname":"t2_5v62p07e","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Considering dropping out of my sister’s wedding","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationships","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"new","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_fen6r8","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":167,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"[new]","can_mod_post":false,"score":167,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":1583541394,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1583569957,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.relationships","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Throwaway for obvious reasons.

He pulled out the comic and was happy to show it to me. </p>\n\n<p>I replied “yea, I have the original at the house in the safe “ he seamed disappointed and said “well damn I thought I had something special “ </p>\n\n<p>He did tho. He also had 2 of dads very early works. Like 10 year difference and you can tell. </p>\n\n<p>So in the long run I’m thankful for my uncle thinking of me to keep everything. I’m also thankful in knowing dads side will be burning in hell sometime during my lifetime. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR:  My uncle had a photo copy of an original comic book my father made. I have the original and have looked at it multiple times. Prior and post his passing </p>\n\n<p>Edit: all uses of uncle is my moms side except the birthday thing</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"1df36664-cb01-11e2-aec7-12313d14782d","can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fe7h0g","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"LaneThrowaway","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":10,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fe7h0g/1_year_update_my_49m_uncle_casually_told_me_22m/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fe7h0g/1_year_update_my_49m_uncle_casually_told_me_22m/","subreddit_subscribers":2795086,"created_utc":1583465488,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},"fccenq":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"I’ve been seeing a girl for about 6 months now and we’re getting on really well and having lots of sex.

He laughed and admitted he would also feel awkward about it because we have different personalities and environments at home.  He asked me why she asked or what was said and when I told him he felt she was asking to have her family meet my daughter, which they have.  Odd as it sounds, this is right up her ally.\n\nWell on top of this we had agreed to share a present this year, a hunting bow, and we discussed how we would pay and also expectations.  One thing I shared is that this is well above a birthday or Christmas gift so I would share with him that if he wants this that it would likely result is less or no bigger ticket items.  He was on board and she had agreed but continued to share her budget for her kids, as if to say “What’s the big deal?”\n\nI also shared that I would prefer for him to contribute some money on many of the accessories needed so he has some skin in the game.  She agreed but also said they might buy something like a case but anything else he “needs” could be paid with birthday money or gifts, or worked off.  I worked with her husband on what to get our son and offered to pay for it and pick it up as he suggested I go take a look with my son and see if I agree.  This is all great!\n\nWell it comes in, and I decide to contact my ex to arrange how we would like to gift this to my son which lead to my prior post.  She said it’s up to me and let her know, and a day or so later I state that Thursday or Friday night would work for me or even Saturday.  We also knew he would need to be fitted for this and my son when asked said he wanted me and his step dad along.  Well I don’t hear anything and finally Thursday night my son calls and after being on the phone shared that his step dad didn’t want to be with as they only allow a technician inside for shooting and we would just be standing there.  Ok fine, so I tell my son that after work on Friday I will pick him up and we will make a night of it before dropping him off at his moms.\n\nNext day, I find out that step dad left work early as he was eager to get this set up with my son, so I am getting asked an hour before my shift ends if I can leave early.  Nope.  Can’t do, however, had it been discussed earlier I may have been able to make to swing.  Regardless I wrap up as soon as I can which is just before 5 and head home to pick up my son, and then go into town to meet step dad.  \n\nWe get there and for the most part it goes well.  We chat while my son is getting fitted and he shared they are picking up the case. I say that I will also chip in a little extra for a release that he will need.  2 hours later they have 7 more items, all things he will eventually need, but won’t need right this second.  $180 more on the bill and I chipped in my $35 as I said I would all week.  So here I look like an cheap ass in front of my son.  We wrap up the night and shakes hands, hug my boy and home I go.  Oh well.\n\nToday my son shared that they went back to town to do some shooting and get re-sighted which I assume was because step dad didn’t like  the store that did it last night.  I realize and even shared they may do more of this at his moms because they live in a rural town and his grandparents have land he can practice and hunt within 5 minutes away from his mom.  I live in town which makes it harder and my land is an hour and a half.\n\nI feel taken advantage of, and while I tried to set expectations as well as be supportive of all of this along with sharing this with my son based on his wishes, that they ultimately did their own thing and showed me up.  It isn’t about money.  I can afford to do more, I just like to raise my son appreciating things, and helping our.  I pay my child support as well.  It just hurts.\n\nTL;DR: Talked with son agreed on what he would prefer for birthdays and holidays!  Tried to coordinate and be supportive of my ex and her husbands feelings about gift as well as setting agreed upon expectations.  Hurt as I feel my feelings were trampled on to show me up, intentional or not.","author_fullname":"t2_wz26n","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Update: Had a great talk with son!

This isn't even that bad compared to a lot of the stuff on here but I just feel like I need to write this down and get it out of me.\n\nI have been dating my girlfriend Ann for 6ish years, we live together, I thought everything was going well, we travel, have fun, see movies, go to nice restaurants, all that stuff. Our sex life started falling off roughly a year ago, Ann started saying she felt gross and had gained weight and didn't want me to see her naked. She also started a new job around this time period. I tried to make sure she knew I still found her attractive, still tried to initiate sex, give her compliments any time she did herself up or even just lounging around the house. Nothing I did seemed to work, but I wanted to keep trying. Outside of the sex stuff, it was business as usual and I felt like we were in a really good spot. She started running and exercising and eating healthier, and it worked, she started losing weight and feeling better about herself, but the sex was still lacking. We went on vacation to a foreign country and after traveling all over and being constantly on the move, I booked us a nice relaxing getaway at the end to just chill and do nothing. I figured this could be my time, tried to initiate sex and she batted me away. After a year of this happening it was my new normal so I just moved on. I did continue complimenting her and trying to be sweet and make her feel good, because thats just something I like to do regardless of sex happening or not.\n\n\nThen around October I started noticing that she was constantly talking about this one coworker named Dan. She was also on her phone ALL the time, and i would often see her trying to take some sort of almost 'covert' selfie while we were sitting watching tv or whatever. If i brought it up she would always say 'oh just sending it to the girls' or w/e. She turned off her location on snapchat, she stopped including me in snaps, even normal ones (i know because it happened multiple times where friends got them and not me). I asked her about this and she would say \"oh your name is so far down the list i just got tired of selecting people\" or stuff like that. Anyways, im not a digital stalker kind of guy (well, i used to not be), so I didn't really care that much, just moved past it (dumb, I know). She would always make sure to mention Dan is married and his wife is super cool and comes to hang out after work for happy hour sometimes, blah blah. I met Dan at her work Christmas party, it was a little weird, but we're strangers so what do I know. Made small talk and moved on.\n\nSo not it really starts, roughly 1 week ago. Life continues, we're having a good time, sex still hasn't improved but I'm holding on with the thought of 'its just a slump it will come'. After work one night we go to a bar for a drink, she was pretty drunk, and while we are sitting there talking I notice out of the corner of my eye that she is using whatsapp. This is strange to me because I know she normally doesn't, so I make a mental note of it and ignore it for the time being. But then when we got home I was sitting on the couch and she was getting ready for bed (I could see her, she couldn’t see me) and I saw her very clearly taking selfies of her face (fully clothed, giving pouty lips/sexy face). Then she said she had to change her tampon so she closed the door but left it slightly cracked. I heard no wrapper open, and I saw her throw her shirt into the dirty laundry hamper, then I heard her put her phone down and continue getting ready, still no tampon wrapper noise. Then she finally goes to bed, I tuck her in, kiss her night and go to get ready for bed on my own, closing the doors on the way out. Then I opened whatsapp and it says shes online, online, online. Finally I get ready for bed and go in the room (she seemed startled), and I said ‘still up?’ and she said “yeah just watching IG stories”. Of course, go on my phone and see she is still online on whatsapp. She finally puts the phone down, I note the time, then notice it says ‘Last seen on’ whatever the time I noted. Exact. So quite clearly texting someone on whatsapp. \n\nSo when she fell asleep I decided to unlock her phone and see what was going on. Open up whatsapp and see the 3 chats, 2 of which I am a part of (from the past) and 1 that is Dan. Open it and the only thing I see is ‘This message was deleted” and there is no chat history. Fishy. Then go check texts, again, no record of ever texting (someone that she has definitely told me she has texted in the past). Very fishy. Open up photos to see what she was taking pics of and find a lot of nudes and semi-nudes going all the way back to September 19 (including the exact time i confronted her about being sketchy in october!!), and maybe even further. Decide to check IG, no record of anything. Decide to check slack and search my name and find outright lies, and lots of ‘venting’ about me to Dan. Some very weird things like I walked in to our apartment to see her getting her hair washed by the guy that cuts her hair (??wtf). stuff about how she doesn’t like fancy restaurants but just goes to them because I like them, she prefers to cook (not true at all). I saw that she told a friend i got really mad at her and she was sleeping at a friends house (also has never happened). She complained to Dan that i was trying to rearrange my Christmas plans to join her in her hometown. She complained that I was making an effort to take her out on dates and go to restaurants and stuff (\"he's just doing it so i dont get mad, not because he wants to\").\n\nI almost felt bad because sometimes Dan would say things like ‘he is trying to be nice why are you being mean to him’ and stuff like that. Bizarre. Take some photos of the screen on my phone because I don’t know how to screenshot on her phone. None of the texts I find are terribly incriminating, but I can tell they are both pretty diligent about deleting texts. Another thing I noticed was that a lot of the images have been compressed, usually something that happens when sending over whatsapp (vs texting). ALSO all of the exif data has been stripped, something that whatsapp is known for. Then I started paying attention in the mornings, and often the first thing she would do is open whatsapp, and I realized it was because she had his notifications muted (so she could continue to show me stuff on her phone without worry of anything popping up). Then I started paying attention more over the past week and she is basically in constant communication with him via whatsapp. I have gone through her phone a couple more times over the past week and managed to find some screenshots she had of messages from between the 2 of them (nothing incriminating, just regular messages on whatsapp and text). She started cooking large batches of really good food on sundays 'to take to work', but i found out via her messages that she was actually taking food for Dan. Another thing I found was a google search for 'how to give best blowjob' on Tuesday (3 days ago), (which was definitely not for me), and 'dizzy after orgasm', and stuff like that. She worked from home Wednesday. Could be a coincidence but most likely not, right? Also she was off birth control for a long period of time (probably 6 months) and started up again out of the blue a couple months ago. Again, could be coincidence, but also probably isn't. \n\nThis morning I woke up and I was upset about it all and I found Dan's wife on FB and IG, and I messaged her a short version of what has happened, on both platforms (because i know sometimes messages from strangers can get lost, and need approval or w/e).

This isn&#39;t even that bad compared to a lot of the stuff on here but I just feel like I need to write this down and get it out of me.</p>\n\n<p>I have been dating my girlfriend Ann for 6ish years, we live together, I thought everything was going well, we travel, have fun, see movies, go to nice restaurants, all that stuff. Our sex life started falling off roughly a year ago, Ann started saying she felt gross and had gained weight and didn&#39;t want me to see her naked. She also started a new job around this time period. I tried to make sure she knew I still found her attractive, still tried to initiate sex, give her compliments any time she did herself up or even just lounging around the house. Nothing I did seemed to work, but I wanted to keep trying. Outside of the sex stuff, it was business as usual and I felt like we were in a really good spot. She started running and exercising and eating healthier, and it worked, she started losing weight and feeling better about herself, but the sex was still lacking. We went on vacation to a foreign country and after traveling all over and being constantly on the move, I booked us a nice relaxing getaway at the end to just chill and do nothing. I figured this could be my time, tried to initiate sex and she batted me away. After a year of this happening it was my new normal so I just moved on. I did continue complimenting her and trying to be sweet and make her feel good, because thats just something I like to do regardless of sex happening or not.</p>\n\n<p>Then around October I started noticing that she was constantly talking about this one coworker named Dan. She was also on her phone ALL the time, and i would often see her trying to take some sort of almost &#39;covert&#39; selfie while we were sitting watching tv or whatever. If i brought it up she would always say &#39;oh just sending it to the girls&#39; or w/e. She turned off her location on snapchat, she stopped including me in snaps, even normal ones (i know because it happened multiple times where friends got them and not me). I asked her about this and she would say &quot;oh your name is so far down the list i just got tired of selecting people&quot; or stuff like that. Anyways, im not a digital stalker kind of guy (well, i used to not be), so I didn&#39;t really care that much, just moved past it (dumb, I know). She would always make sure to mention Dan is married and his wife is super cool and comes to hang out after work for happy hour sometimes, blah blah. I met Dan at her work Christmas party, it was a little weird, but we&#39;re strangers so what do I know. Made small talk and moved on.</p>\n\n<p>So not it really starts, roughly 1 week ago. Life continues, we&#39;re having a good time, sex still hasn&#39;t improved but I&#39;m holding on with the thought of &#39;its just a slump it will come&#39;. After work one night we go to a bar for a drink, she was pretty drunk, and while we are sitting there talking I notice out of the corner of my eye that she is using whatsapp. This is strange to me because I know she normally doesn&#39;t, so I make a mental note of it and ignore it for the time being. But then when we got home I was sitting on the couch and she was getting ready for bed (I could see her, she couldn’t see me) and I saw her very clearly taking selfies of her face (fully clothed, giving pouty lips/sexy face). Then she said she had to change her tampon so she closed the door but left it slightly cracked. I heard no wrapper open, and I saw her throw her shirt into the dirty laundry hamper, then I heard her put her phone down and continue getting ready, still no tampon wrapper noise. Then she finally goes to bed, I tuck her in, kiss her night and go to get ready for bed on my own, closing the doors on the way out. Then I opened whatsapp and it says shes online, online, online. Finally I get ready for bed and go in the room (she seemed startled), and I said ‘still up?’ and she said “yeah just watching IG stories”. Of course, go on my phone and see she is still online on whatsapp. She finally puts the phone down, I note the time, then notice it says ‘Last seen on’ whatever the time I noted. Exact. So quite clearly texting someone on whatsapp. </p>\n\n<p>So when she fell asleep I decided to unlock her phone and see what was going on. Open up whatsapp and see the 3 chats, 2 of which I am a part of (from the past) and 1 that is Dan. Open it and the only thing I see is ‘This message was deleted” and there is no chat history. Fishy. Then go check texts, again, no record of ever texting (someone that she has definitely told me she has texted in the past). Very fishy. Open up photos to see what she was taking pics of and find a lot of nudes and semi-nudes going all the way back to September 19 (including the exact time i confronted her about being sketchy in october!!), and maybe even further. Decide to check IG, no record of anything. Decide to check slack and search my name and find outright lies, and lots of ‘venting’ about me to Dan. Some very weird things like I walked in to our apartment to see her getting her hair washed by the guy that cuts her hair (??wtf). stuff about how she doesn’t like fancy restaurants but just goes to them because I like them, she prefers to cook (not true at all). I saw that she told a friend i got really mad at her and she was sleeping at a friends house (also has never happened). She complained to Dan that i was trying to rearrange my Christmas plans to join her in her hometown. She complained that I was making an effort to take her out on dates and go to restaurants and stuff (&quot;he&#39;s just doing it so i dont get mad, not because he wants to&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>I almost felt bad because sometimes Dan would say things like ‘he is trying to be nice why are you being mean to him’ and stuff like that. Bizarre. Take some photos of the screen on my phone because I don’t know how to screenshot on her phone. None of the texts I find are terribly incriminating, but I can tell they are both pretty diligent about deleting texts. Another thing I noticed was that a lot of the images have been compressed, usually something that happens when sending over whatsapp (vs texting). ALSO all of the exif data has been stripped, something that whatsapp is known for. Then I started paying attention in the mornings, and often the first thing she would do is open whatsapp, and I realized it was because she had his notifications muted (so she could continue to show me stuff on her phone without worry of anything popping up). Then I started paying attention more over the past week and she is basically in constant communication with him via whatsapp. I have gone through her phone a couple more times over the past week and managed to find some screenshots she had of messages from between the 2 of them (nothing incriminating, just regular messages on whatsapp and text). She started cooking large batches of really good food on sundays &#39;to take to work&#39;, but i found out via her messages that she was actually taking food for Dan. Another thing I found was a google search for &#39;how to give best blowjob&#39; on Tuesday (3 days ago), (which was definitely not for me), and &#39;dizzy after orgasm&#39;, and stuff like that. She worked from home Wednesday. Could be a coincidence but most likely not, right? Also she was off birth control for a long period of time (probably 6 months) and started up again out of the blue a couple months ago. Again, could be coincidence, but also probably isn&#39;t. </p>\n\n<p>This morning I woke up and I was upset about it all and I found Dan&#39;s wife on FB and IG, and I messaged her a short version of what has happened, on both platforms (because i know sometimes messages from strangers can get lost, and need approval or w/e).

Regardless, he's begun taking out his anger on our roommates, and he shows no remorse. I'm really hesitant to sign another lease with him and our current lease is ending in just a couple months, but I don't know how to navigate that and the consequences.\n\nRepost with some clarification since the original was removed. Sorry for the ridiculous wall of text!\n\nMy boyfriend and I (both 20M) met around 8 years ago, and started dating around 3.5 years ago. We've lived together with two other roommates since last August. It's really special dating someone I was such good friends with from early in life and when I was initially attracted to how fun, compassionate and caring we was. But things have changed recently, and I don't know if it's my fault or what.\n\nAlthough I feel like some of my boyfriend's behavior is a bit out of hand, I feel like I've had it coming to some extent and it would only be fair to talk about the bad things I've done.\n\nI've always been weirdly private about completely innocuous things. For whatever reason, the idea of someone finding out anything remotely personal to me or seeing me do anything to stick out, even if completely normal, made me really uncomfortable for a long time. When I first moved in with my BF and friends, I was a bit uncomfortable showing much affection with them around since it's a more personal side of myself that I'm not used to showing around them. Understandably, he's gotten very frustrated about this, and I've been improving that in the past few months. One time, though, I got into his car with my friend, and my friend and I just sort of continued our conversation and I didn't say much to my BF. He got super mad at me for this and I feel like I was really shitty here. I try to make sure I show him that I love him despite my dumb hang ups now.\n\nThe worst thing was Valentine's day. I knew my BF likes gifts and I bought him his favorite game for Christmas, but I really fucked up here. Being insane busy with school and honestly almost forgetting about the day entirely (I'm the kind of guy who expects nothing for Christmas and prefers for people to ignore my birthday), I didn't get him anything. I thought we were just going to go out and have a nice dinner together, but he actually made some really nice gestures, treating me to dinner and giving me a card with a nice note and a gift card to one of my favorite restaurants. He told me how unappreciated he felt, and I've been working to make sure that nothing like this happens again. I've started treating him to dinner occasionally, and I've set aside some money and have bought him a gift to surprise him with (later on when it's done).\n\nProblem is, I really don't like a lot of the ways he likes to show affection. I'll be on the couch talking to my friend, and literally in the middle of the conversation he'll walk into the room and start trying to play wrestle with me. Or he'll lie on the ground and demand that I lie down next to/on top of him and cuddle. I'd rather he sit next to me and cuddle a bit more low key since there are other people in the room I am actively talking to, but whenever I attempt to communicate this he just ignores me and keeps calling my name. I even suggest we go into our room to cuddle there, but he just tells me no, cuddle me right here!!! Eventually I start feeling really pressured and overwhelmed so I leave the room, which leaves him feeling hurt and abandoned and I feel like I've wronged him.\n\nAnother issue is related to his playfulness. I love play wrestling and ticking and stuff with him, but most of the time he just doesn't know when to stop. I feel crazy saying this, but it feels like whenever I tell him I don't like something he does to me, he purposefully does it more/again just to annoy me. He likes to go for my pressure points on my sides, and despite how many times I've told him not to do that, it hurts, slap his hand away, etc, I still get pokes there every once in a while. I straight up told him \"I do not like when you do that. It hurts. I want you to stop,\" and he just dismissed me and said \"whatever.\" I got onto him for that and he told me \"fine! I'll stop!\" not angrily, but it honestly felt like he was just trying to get me to shut up. He also doesn't seem to understand when I actually want him to stop, and when I groan or tell him \"no seriously\" he just mocks whatever I'm saying and continues.\n\nRelated to this is his sexual displays of affection. I like them in the right time and place, but sometimes it's just a bit too much. He'll grab my dick when we're casually hanging out at school in the middle of the day despite my protests. Things like this. I once told him to keep it low key around where I work (I have a job on campus), and literally 10 minutes later he gives my ass a nice big slap *as I'm walking into the room to attend a meeting*. I don't think my boss saw or anything, but come on.\n\nHe also has some issues with anger and depression, which have been present since the beginning of the relationship. What really freaks me out is that often he'll act out in a pretty dramatic way, including yelling and doing whatever he's doing in a more violent manner, and then later act like nothing happened, although I'll still be pretty shaken from the whole thing. A couple of times he's even denied anything having happened altogether.\n\nOne time I came out into the kitchen, and he had opened the fridge to find oil spilled everywhere and all over the floor. He got pissed the hell off about this. He yelled at me, asking me if I had used the fridge, looking to blame me for the spill. Yelling \"GOD DAMMIT\" at the top of his lungs and talking about how he shouldn't have to do this shit after coming home from work. I told him he didn't have to and I could handle it, but he continued to clean and yell, throwing paper towels or sponges or whatever on the floor with all of his strength to let out his anger without damaging anything. My friend/roommate was super freaked out at the scene and had to ask me the next day what the hell happened. \n\nAnother time, most of our clothes were dirty and the only clean shirt I had was a polo with the last button missing (I could still button the upper button and look fine). I offhandedly asked him if I should wear it, and he told me no. I asked him why, and he told me sternly \"Just listen to me. You will NOT wear that to school.\" At this point I thought he was joking and being sarcastic since the reaction was already disproportionate to the situation, but then he just went \"Jesus fucking Christ,\" stormed out of the room, and slammed the door. Later, I emerged from my room to prepare lunch in the kitchen real quick before leaving, and he got really pissed at one of our roommates for hanging his work apron up on the hook specifically meant for the aprons, telling him not to leave his shit where he outs it (he usually leaves the aprons on the cough, the kitchen counter, or the living room floor). He then tripped over some gaming stuff *he* had left out the night before, got more pissed kicked it into place, yelled something about why is this shit out, and left the apartment. I followed him to the car, wearing that polo because the only alternative was a dirty stinky shirt, and he yelled at me through the car window \"ARE YOU WEARING THAT FUCKING SHIRT?!?!\" I got into the car and said it wasn't a big deal, and he told me \"Don't come crying to me later today when you start getting looks from people.\" Nothing important was happening that day, and the button honestly was barely noticeable.\n\nLater when I confronted him about his reaction, acknowledging that I shouldn't have asked him for advice if I wasn't going to take it but his anger was a bit much, he doubled down on his reaction, saying \"I get angry when you do stupid shit like wear a shirt with a missing button.\" I told him no one is going to care about the button and it's okay, and he said he guessed he just noticed details like that. No apology at all.\n\nA couple times he's also straight up told me \"Just do what I tell you,\" completely seriously, in front of my friends when I ask him why I need to do something in his very specific way.\n\nMore recently, I was at home cooking with one of my roommates when he got home and I gave him the usual hug and kiss. He was already a bit on edge, though, and after he changed his clothes and started relaxing on the couch, I started helping clean out the kitchen of old expired food with my two other roommates. There were a couple of old jugs of milk in the fridge, and there was a jug of milk on the counter that my roommate had just used, and my BF told my roommate to throw out the milk. My roommate told him \"no, that's my milk, it's not expired,\" and IMMEDIATELY my BF goes off on him. \"Jesus Christ, just throw out the fucking milk! Why do you have to question me?!\" and we're all just like what?? A few minutes later, something else came up, I forgot exactly what about, and it sounded like a perfectly normal exchange until my BF went off on my roommate again out of nowhere, saying he's always showing him so much \"fucking attitude.\" All of us were completely confused at how he turned this totally innocuous exchange into a huge issue. A couple minutes later, he made some casual suggestion with a super angry tone, and my roommate told him that we were doing some other thing, a completely normal conversation that would have ended right there if I were in his position. But he immediately blew up. \"JESUS FUCKING CHRIST FINE. I GUESS I'M JUST AN ASSHOLE. I SHOULD JUST KILL MYSELF.\"\n\nI really didn't know what to do at this point. This was so ridiculously jarring I can't even describe it. I can't just say \"yeah you are being an asshole\" because I feel like I'm supposed to support him as a boyfriend, and if I make a wrong move he might lash out at me. But at the same time, he's hurting my friends. I really hate confrontation, so I froze up for a minute, retreated into my room, and texted him, asking him what was wrong and if he was okay. He complained to me about having to come home to their shit. Said they probably hate him, said \"GOOD, I HATE ME TOO. I SHOULD JUST GO FUCK MYSELF\", and mentioned how draining his job is. I told him I was sorry about his job but he can't let it ruin his whole day like this. No response. \n\nLater on, he comes into the room, cheery and playful, acting like nothing ever happened. The next morning, he's the same way, but I'm honestly still completely shaken at how he was acting. He asks me what's wrong, and when I told him it's about last night, he told me \"well, I'm not angry now!\" I told him that he shouldn't take out his anger on my friends, and he told me \"fuck 'em, they can just deal with it.\" I said they really shouldn't have to. He says he really wishes he didn't have to live with them and deal with their shit, and the conversation ended around there.\n\nI'm honestly afraid of asserting myself any more than that, because I feel like if I push too hard, he'll snap at me. Every night, I'm worried that he'll be in a shit mood again when he comes home and cause a scene, and my roommate mentioned feeling the same thing a couple times.\n\nAnother issue is that he's often really inconsiderate of our roommates. One of my roommates has a medical problem that requires him to sleep upright, which he can't manage on his bed, and so he sleeps on the couch. My BF will walk in late at night, turn on all the lights, make much more noise in the kitchen than necessary, frustrated at my friend for sleeping in the living room. I've heard him literally call out my friends name to specifically wake him up for no reason other than to mess with him. \n\nWe have a water filter/pitcher in the fridge that was supposed to be for all of us to use, but he puts his mouth up to it and drinks straight from it. My roommates have expressed disgust at this and I've told him that he should really stop, but according to my roommates he continues. They literally buy their own gallons of water from the store now because of this.\n\nHe'll also often come into the room super late and wake me up when I have to wake up early the next morning. I understand that he gets home late from work, but he could be a bit more careful. He comes into the room loudly, turns on all the lights, and showers with the door open, singing loudly. He then comes to bed and specifically wakes me up to play. I told him super politely about this issue, and he asked me what I expected, for him to navigate the room completely in the dark? He needs the lights. Ironically, I do literally this and try my best not to wake him up when I come in after him. He sings in the shower, and I told him I really love his singing, but I'd prefer not to have it waking me up at 1 in the morning. He just straight up told me he's not going to stop doing that.\n\nAnother thing is that he often expects me to completely abandon my own judgements of a situation and put my complete trust in his. He knows some really personal facts about me personally and sexually that I would prefer to keep private, but he often teases me with them. He'll make unnecessary remarks about them loud enough for someone in the next room to hear, and very often will straight up say loudly \"[my name] IS INTOOOOO...\" and slowly complete the sentence while I'm begging him to stop. He must find my begging cute or something, because he then mocks me, repeating it back playfully. One time he even made a \"subtle\" joke about one of these things in front of both of our roommates literally the day after I told him SPECIFICALLY to never make that joke in front of anybody else ever because it's embarrassing and something that should be kept private. I completely ignored it because any reaction on my part would've made it infinitely more humiliating. \n\nI know it's stupid since this was a long time ago, but around two years ago while we were at an RV resort he pressured me to have sex with him in the public bathroom there. I was SUPER uncomfortable with that and made it abundantly clear, but he kept telling me it was fine and to trust him. I complied and went to get a shower with him. In the shower he started groping me and I honestly felt so dirty and terrible and did not reciprocate. After the shower he got mad at me for not trusting him that it would be fine. I know it's dumb since this was one thing from a long time ago, but it stands out in my memory.\n\nWhen I try to talk to him about this and tell him it bothers me, he gets really pissy, telling me he's just trying to have fun and I'm ruining it, and that he's really hurt that I can't just trust him that it's fine and no one will hear. I tell him that it's not about trust and that I can make my own judgements of the situation based off of information that I have, and he just gets angry that I don't trust him. I really won't know how to continue, so I'll give up and he'll come back half an hour later crying, remorseful, telling me that he's an asshole and I shouldn't have to put up with him and he'll change, and I have to try and console him. He'll get better about it just long enough for me to forget about it, and then fall back into his old habits. I'm already really averse to confrontation, but his dismissal and anger make it hard for me not to keep many issues to myself. \n\nI could go on and on. I'm starting to get really frustrated at these things, but part of me feels like I have it coming for not satisfying him enough, not being affectionate enough, not getting him enough gifts, and just not being a good enough boyfriend. I feel like I almost have to choose between my friends and him with the friction building between them, and I'm hesitant to sign another lease with him knowing these problems could continue. But I'm too afraid to bring this up because I have no idea how it would pan out, how he would react or how I would handle it, and I don't want to hurt him. \n\nAm I in the wrong here? When he's not angry he's really fun, playful, funny, and loving and it makes me feel really weird and guilty for having any problem with him at all. We're both part of an online community, and when he's behind a screen he acts so wholesome and compassionate and people love him. It's the same thing with his friends who aren't around him as much as our roommates, and in fact this is why I was initially attracted to him. Him acting the way he does and then going back to this other persona has really been messing with my head. I'm sure he doesn't mean me any harm, but I feel like he's honestly gotten worse and part of it is my fault. I also feel really shitty for bringing my roommates/friends into this mess. I did not anticipate him acting this way towards them. It's becoming extremely stressful and I honestly don't know what to do.","author_fullname":"t2_5iz0u904","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Boyfriend (20M) has anger issues and has involved our roommates.

I&#39;m really hesitant to sign another lease with him and our current lease is ending in just a couple months, but I don&#39;t know how to navigate that and the consequences.</p>\n\n<p>Repost with some clarification since the original was removed. Sorry for the ridiculous wall of text!</p>\n\n<p>My boyfriend and I (both 20M) met around 8 years ago, and started dating around 3.5 years ago. We&#39;ve lived together with two other roommates since last August. It&#39;s really special dating someone I was such good friends with from early in life and when I was initially attracted to how fun, compassionate and caring we was. But things have changed recently, and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s my fault or what.</p>\n\n<p>Although I feel like some of my boyfriend&#39;s behavior is a bit out of hand, I feel like I&#39;ve had it coming to some extent and it would only be fair to talk about the bad things I&#39;ve done.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve always been weirdly private about completely innocuous things. For whatever reason, the idea of someone finding out anything remotely personal to me or seeing me do anything to stick out, even if completely normal, made me really uncomfortable for a long time. When I first moved in with my BF and friends, I was a bit uncomfortable showing much affection with them around since it&#39;s a more personal side of myself that I&#39;m not used to showing around them. Understandably, he&#39;s gotten very frustrated about this, and I&#39;ve been improving that in the past few months. One time, though, I got into his car with my friend, and my friend and I just sort of continued our conversation and I didn&#39;t say much to my BF. He got super mad at me for this and I feel like I was really shitty here. I try to make sure I show him that I love him despite my dumb hang ups now.</p>\n\n<p>The worst thing was Valentine&#39;s day. I knew my BF likes gifts and I bought him his favorite game for Christmas, but I really fucked up here. Being insane busy with school and honestly almost forgetting about the day entirely (I&#39;m the kind of guy who expects nothing for Christmas and prefers for people to ignore my birthday), I didn&#39;t get him anything. I thought we were just going to go out and have a nice dinner together, but he actually made some really nice gestures, treating me to dinner and giving me a card with a nice note and a gift card to one of my favorite restaurants. He told me how unappreciated he felt, and I&#39;ve been working to make sure that nothing like this happens again. I&#39;ve started treating him to dinner occasionally, and I&#39;ve set aside some money and have bought him a gift to surprise him with (later on when it&#39;s done).</p>\n\n<p>Problem is, I really don&#39;t like a lot of the ways he likes to show affection. I&#39;ll be on the couch talking to my friend, and literally in the middle of the conversation he&#39;ll walk into the room and start trying to play wrestle with me. Or he&#39;ll lie on the ground and demand that I lie down next to/on top of him and cuddle. I&#39;d rather he sit next to me and cuddle a bit more low key since there are other people in the room I am actively talking to, but whenever I attempt to communicate this he just ignores me and keeps calling my name. I even suggest we go into our room to cuddle there, but he just tells me no, cuddle me right here!!! Eventually I start feeling really pressured and overwhelmed so I leave the room, which leaves him feeling hurt and abandoned and I feel like I&#39;ve wronged him.</p>\n\n<p>Another issue is related to his playfulness. I love play wrestling and ticking and stuff with him, but most of the time he just doesn&#39;t know when to stop. I feel crazy saying this, but it feels like whenever I tell him I don&#39;t like something he does to me, he purposefully does it more/again just to annoy me. He likes to go for my pressure points on my sides, and despite how many times I&#39;ve told him not to do that, it hurts, slap his hand away, etc, I still get pokes there every once in a while. I straight up told him &quot;I do not like when you do that. It hurts. I want you to stop,&quot; and he just dismissed me and said &quot;whatever.&quot; I got onto him for that and he told me &quot;fine! I&#39;ll stop!&quot; not angrily, but it honestly felt like he was just trying to get me to shut up. He also doesn&#39;t seem to understand when I actually want him to stop, and when I groan or tell him &quot;no seriously&quot; he just mocks whatever I&#39;m saying and continues.</p>\n\n<p>Related to this is his sexual displays of affection. I like them in the right time and place, but sometimes it&#39;s just a bit too much. He&#39;ll grab my dick when we&#39;re casually hanging out at school in the middle of the day despite my protests. Things like this. I once told him to keep it low key around where I work (I have a job on campus), and literally 10 minutes later he gives my ass a nice big slap <em>as I&#39;m walking into the room to attend a meeting</em>. I don&#39;t think my boss saw or anything, but come on.</p>\n\n<p>He also has some issues with anger and depression, which have been present since the beginning of the relationship. What really freaks me out is that often he&#39;ll act out in a pretty dramatic way, including yelling and doing whatever he&#39;s doing in a more violent manner, and then later act like nothing happened, although I&#39;ll still be pretty shaken from the whole thing. A couple of times he&#39;s even denied anything having happened altogether.</p>\n\n<p>One time I came out into the kitchen, and he had opened the fridge to find oil spilled everywhere and all over the floor. He got pissed the hell off about this. He yelled at me, asking me if I had used the fridge, looking to blame me for the spill. Yelling &quot;GOD DAMMIT&quot; at the top of his lungs and talking about how he shouldn&#39;t have to do this shit after coming home from work. I told him he didn&#39;t have to and I could handle it, but he continued to clean and yell, throwing paper towels or sponges or whatever on the floor with all of his strength to let out his anger without damaging anything. My friend/roommate was super freaked out at the scene and had to ask me the next day what the hell happened. </p>\n\n<p>Another time, most of our clothes were dirty and the only clean shirt I had was a polo with the last button missing (I could still button the upper button and look fine). I offhandedly asked him if I should wear it, and he told me no. I asked him why, and he told me sternly &quot;Just listen to me. You will NOT wear that to school.&quot; At this point I thought he was joking and being sarcastic since the reaction was already disproportionate to the situation, but then he just went &quot;Jesus fucking Christ,&quot; stormed out of the room, and slammed the door. Later, I emerged from my room to prepare lunch in the kitchen real quick before leaving, and he got really pissed at one of our roommates for hanging his work apron up on the hook specifically meant for the aprons, telling him not to leave his shit where he outs it (he usually leaves the aprons on the cough, the kitchen counter, or the living room floor). He then tripped over some gaming stuff <em>he</em> had left out the night before, got more pissed kicked it into place, yelled something about why is this shit out, and left the apartment. I followed him to the car, wearing that polo because the only alternative was a dirty stinky shirt, and he yelled at me through the car window &quot;ARE YOU WEARING THAT FUCKING SHIRT?!?!&quot; I got into the car and said it wasn&#39;t a big deal, and he told me &quot;Don&#39;t come crying to me later today when you start getting looks from people.&quot; Nothing important was happening that day, and the button honestly was barely noticeable.</p>\n\n<p>Later when I confronted him about his reaction, acknowledging that I shouldn&#39;t have asked him for advice if I wasn&#39;t going to take it but his anger was a bit much, he doubled down on his reaction, saying &quot;I get angry when you do stupid shit like wear a shirt with a missing button.&quot; I told him no one is going to care about the button and it&#39;s okay, and he said he guessed he just noticed details like that.

When I got to a point that I could check my phone, I asked if he called, since sometimes butt dials happen. He makes a joke saying \"yeah that brick in your purse that you text on, it also takes calls. You should try it\". Sounds kinda rude but it's not bothering me. I told him I was driving and didn't see he called. So I call him back. It goes to voicemail. Then right after he says \"mmmhmmm sure. Not even gonna call me back? It's like you've never heard of phone etiquette\" to which I respond that I just did and that it went to voicemail. But he says he had zero missed calls and I send him a screenshot showing I had just called. So I call him again and he answers and says \"well look who finally called me back\" I don't remember everything that was said, but the gist of it was him telling me I should answer my phone more and me telling him I'm driving. \n\nI honestly don't know what the deal is, but basically the conversation quickly got heated and we hung up after a minute or two. On the drive home, I'm thinking he was mad that I didn't answer my phone and how ridiculous that is to be mad about. So when I get home, he immediately says something about it and asked why I was so mad, and I'm like what!? You're the mad one! Why are YOU mad that I missed your call. I tried to calmly talk to him about how I was interpreting our conversation, that he had a problem with how I did not answer my phone and that is not my problem. But he said that I was being condescending and talking to him like a child. My options were to talk to him as calmly as I could, yell at him, or not talk to him at all. So I immediately get frustrated and tell him no he is obviously trying to start some shit and I'm walking away. So I leave to go to the bedroom, but then come out after a few minutes to grab my phone and read his texts he had just sent that said \"I'm not even upset and I want to speak to you, but you will not let.me speak and are being condescending to me. Can you please be an adult and talk to me. Telling me it's my fault because you didn't answer your phone is the complete wrong way to approach this situation\". At this point I'm confused. In no way did I state it was his fault that I didn't answer my phone. That literally makes no sense. \n\nOur argument got a little more heated and he told me how it didn't matter that HE was the one calling, it could've been anyone, and that I needed to answer my phone. I'm like are you kidding me, not only was I driving, but I have complete control over what calls I take or not. He escalates it to what if he were dying (which we've already had this argument) and he needed to get in touch with me. To which I always reply, do not call me in a life or death emergency. Call an ambulance!!! At the end of this argument, it was clear he just wanted to lecture me on my phone habits and complain about it to me under the guise of \"constructive criticism\". The whole thing was a shit show and I may have told him he was gaslighting me and I felt that this was a form of abuse. That was probably not the right response, but in that moment, I swear he was twisting the truth to manipulate what was actually happening. He freaked out when I said he was acting abusive and escalated things even more by saying I basically told him he's \"the worst person in the world and that he should just go slit his throat\" (literally what he said). On top of all of that, I asked him, so what did you want to talk about on the phone? And he says \"nothing\". So he literally didn't even have anything important to say that I needed to answer his call. \n\nThe confusion doesn't stop there. He often tells me to stop talking to him during an argument or interrupting him so that he can talk, but is actually just berating me without ever resting for me to get a word in. I try to listen to him, but the shit he says is honestly so ridiculous that I can't even take him seriously. \n\nWriting all of this out really makes me realize how unhealthy our arguing habits are and I hate it so much. It always devolves into the same thing. He says and does the same things while saying I say and do the same things. \n\nHonestly, if someone could provide some advice as how better to handle these situations where one of us gets defensive over something stupid... That'd be great. \n\nI kept thinking how this is an issue we need to tackle as a team... But the issue is that he doesn't like my phone answering habits??

Long time lurker, not much of a talker, but im feeling pretty stuck, and need some unbiased opinions. \n\nTo start, we got together when I was fairly fresh 18. I had just moved to a rather small town from a very big city 8 hours away to be closer to family. I only moved to get myself together, and never planned to stay long. I decided one day to head to a local bar to play some pool. He worked there, we met, and hit it off immediately. \nFrom the start I told him i wanted to move back to my hometown, and that I was working on making that happen. \n\nThings were going well and I moved in about 6 months later, (I was living with my parents). He offered to cover bills, so that i could just save up money and get my finances in order. Although I still helped with bills often. After only a month or two of living together things started to get weird. He was oddly obsessive about me becoming an independent person, and pushed me to prove that I could live on my own. He told me he would like me to move out and get my own place. I found this odd as i had been living on my own and taking care of myself since 15, and I didn't really need to prove that I could take care of myself, but for some reason i agreed and got an apartment. \n\nI lived in my new apartment for about 3 months. During this time we still spent a lot of time together. Since we live in such a small town, a walk across town is a 5 minute walk, so we often met up at each others places, or at the local pub where i worked to play pool. After 3 months, he asked me to move back in with him, since it would make more sense financially. I was upset when he asked me, since he pushed me so hard to get my own place, and i had signed a year lease. I did not give him an answer for a few weeks, and finally i agreed to move back in if he helped me move. I asked my landlord for a break in my lease and he agreed. A week later i moved back in. He did not help what so ever with the move, and complained that i had a lot of stuff. He often pushed me to get rid of my Things, as they were cluttering up his space. This led to many arguments as i really did not have that much stuff. I had a coffee table, art supplies, and my clothss and that was about it. \n\nThroughout the next year we fought a lot. I had gained about 30 pounds due to going off my meds (something he pushed me to do) and often brought up that since i gained weight i am not as attractive. We went from having sex almost daily, to once a week, when he feels like it. We stopped socializing as a couple, since he had lost a lot of friends due to being a loud mouthed bartender, and eventually lost his job due to it. He is very outspoken, and comes off aggressive when he doesn't agree with things. Our social life and sex life has tanked, and many of the arguments regarding them get pushed onto me. \n\nI have spoken to some of my friends about things he has said or done, and they say he is manipulative and is trying to project his issues onto me, instead of fixing them. I eventually got fed up with it, and i left in October of 2019. I packed up all of my things and moved out, and only left him a note. I decided i needed to focus on my original goal of moving back home, and moved back in with my parents to save up money. I stayed away for about 2 weeks, until I started seeing him again. We reconnected sexually and emotionally, and decided to try things again. Things were going well for about 3 weeks. I was still staying at my parents, but would spend the night about 2 nights a week. I eventually decided to move back in, around Christmas. \n\nAt this point I got him a job at my place of work (foster care home). And although we never worked the same shifts, things were still very close quarters. We had been talking about moving to my hometown together, and we're trying to save up as much money as possible. About a month in, he got into a heated argument with one of the kids at work. A few days later he was called into work, and was fired for how he spoke to the kid. An hour later when i went into work, i was also fired, but not given a reason why. I strongly believe he is the reason i lost my job. A week ago i was offered a chance to come back to work there, and when i told him he got extremely angry. He was yelling at me about how I was not a good example for the kids, i wasn't a good worker, and of all people they should be offering him his job back. We have been arguing and fighting almost every day. I am still wanting to move home, but he is now telling me it cant happen, and that it's too stressful. He has been using this excuse every time we talk about moving, and always says we will save for a few months, but he never does. I will save money, and he won't. \n\nI am starting to feel that my friends are right and that I am being manipulated and held back for his financial gain. He doesn't do anything around the house, and only works part time. I am still looking for a new job, but he berates me for not having one yet. I'm currently almost completely reliant on him, and he suddenly seems much more calm, and isnt fighting with me as much as when im working and financially independent. Am i being manipulated? Is this a toxic situation? I feel really stuck and I don't know what to do at this point. I'm just waiting for my tax return so i can hopefully get out. \n\n\nTldr; my boyfriend cant make up his mind, and tells me it's my fault, he has been holding me back from my goal for 2 years for various reasons, is this manipulative?","author_fullname":"t2_5g2br7c7","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"I (20F) am in a possibly manipulative relationship with my 2 year boyfriend (33M)","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationships","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"m-vt relationships","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_fdapf3","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":69,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Relationships","can_mod_post":false,"score":69,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1583343707,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.relationships","allow_live_comments":true,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi redditors!

He offered to cover bills, so that i could just save up money and get my finances in order. Although I still helped with bills often. After only a month or two of living together things started to get weird. He was oddly obsessive about me becoming an independent person, and pushed me to prove that I could live on my own. He told me he would like me to move out and get my own place. I found this odd as i had been living on my own and taking care of myself since 15, and I didn&#39;t really need to prove that I could take care of myself, but for some reason i agreed and got an apartment. </p>\n\n<p>I lived in my new apartment for about 3 months. During this time we still spent a lot of time together. Since we live in such a small town, a walk across town is a 5 minute walk, so we often met up at each others places, or at the local pub where i worked to play pool. After 3 months, he asked me to move back in with him, since it would make more sense financially. I was upset when he asked me, since he pushed me so hard to get my own place, and i had signed a year lease. I did not give him an answer for a few weeks, and finally i agreed to move back in if he helped me move. I asked my landlord for a break in my lease and he agreed. A week later i moved back in. He did not help what so ever with the move, and complained that i had a lot of stuff. He often pushed me to get rid of my Things, as they were cluttering up his space. This led to many arguments as i really did not have that much stuff. I had a coffee table, art supplies, and my clothss and that was about it. </p>\n\n<p>Throughout the next year we fought a lot. I had gained about 30 pounds due to going off my meds (something he pushed me to do) and often brought up that since i gained weight i am not as attractive. We went from having sex almost daily, to once a week, when he feels like it. We stopped socializing as a couple, since he had lost a lot of friends due to being a loud mouthed bartender, and eventually lost his job due to it. He is very outspoken, and comes off aggressive when he doesn&#39;t agree with things. Our social life and sex life has tanked, and many of the arguments regarding them get pushed onto me. </p>\n\n<p>I have spoken to some of my friends about things he has said or done, and they say he is manipulative and is trying to project his issues onto me, instead of fixing them. I eventually got fed up with it, and i left in October of 2019. I packed up all of my things and moved out, and only left him a note. I decided i needed to focus on my original goal of moving back home, and moved back in with my parents to save up money. I stayed away for about 2 weeks, until I started seeing him again. We reconnected sexually and emotionally, and decided to try things again. Things were going well for about 3 weeks. I was still staying at my parents, but would spend the night about 2 nights a week. I eventually decided to move back in, around Christmas. </p>\n\n<p>At this point I got him a job at my place of work (foster care home). And although we never worked the same shifts, things were still very close quarters. We had been talking about moving to my hometown together, and we&#39;re trying to save up as much money as possible. About a month in, he got into a heated argument with one of the kids at work. A few days later he was called into work, and was fired for how he spoke to the kid. An hour later when i went into work, i was also fired, but not given a reason why. I strongly believe he is the reason i lost my job. A week ago i was offered a chance to come back to work there, and when i told him he got extremely angry. He was yelling at me about how I was not a good example for the kids, i wasn&#39;t a good worker, and of all people they should be offering him his job back. We have been arguing and fighting almost every day. I am still wanting to move home, but he is now telling me it cant happen, and that it&#39;s too stressful. He has been using this excuse every time we talk about moving, and always says we will save for a few months, but he never does. I will save money, and he won&#39;t. </p>\n\n<p>I am starting to feel that my friends are right and that I am being manipulated and held back for his financial gain. He doesn&#39;t do anything around the house, and only works part time. I am still looking for a new job, but he berates me for not having one yet. I&#39;m currently almost completely reliant on him, and he suddenly seems much more calm, and isnt fighting with me as much as when im working and financially independent. Am i being manipulated? Is this a toxic situation? I feel really stuck and I don&#39;t know what to do at this point. I&#39;m just waiting for my tax return so i can hopefully get out. </p>\n\n<p>Tldr; my boyfriend cant make up his mind, and tells me it&#39;s my fault, he has been holding me back from my goal for 2 years for various reasons, is this manipulative?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"c8ef68fc-cb00-11e2-8393-12313d262949","can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fdapf3","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"weezurrd","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":90,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fdapf3/i_20f_am_in_a_possibly_manipulative_relationship/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fdapf3/i_20f_am_in_a_possibly_manipulative_relationship/","subreddit_subscribers":2795086,"created_utc":1583314907,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},"fbxprl":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"I work from home as a web developer and my superior at that company is a woman the same age as me.\n\nUsually we talk 2-3 times per week on webcam to touch base and discuss things.\n\nA few days ago when we were talking, at the end of the talk I asked her how's she's been and how her week was going.\n\nMy GF overheard it and was very angry afterwards and said it was inappropriate and that I should not have any personal conversations with any woman at all while in a relationship, not even asking 'how are you', and that I should strictly only talk about work with her, never anything else.\n\nThen went on to ask how I would feel if she were to talk to guys.

So my boyfriend and I have been together for about 2.5 years. We have a lot of good going for us, but one reoccurring discussion we have is around time. I am not perfect about managing my time, but if I am running late, I will always communicate it with an updated ETA. To me that feels like it's bare minimum and important.\n\nHe and I have had a couple of not so fun discussions over the years when he would double book himself, or people please too much (aka feel like he \"can't leave\" his plans) leaving me waiting at home for several hours when we had plans. I don't care if he wants to stay somewhere longer, just communicate that to me, so that I can make other plans and not sit. I was very clear that this wasn’t fair to me, and it stopped being an issue - except when it comes to travel plans or out of the ordinary events (like the below.)\n\nSo, I have a desk job, but I do art on the side. I got my very first art show (yay!) after about 12 years of practicing this craft. I was so excited and proud. My sister flew in, my parents and grandparents came, a bunch of friends drove in, I felt very loved and supported. I told my boyfriend like 12 weeks out that I was taking a half day to pick up my sister from the airport, and to get lunch and pack the cars with food/alcohol/table clothes etc, and get ready for the show. He said “I will take off too!” He volunteered a half day ahead of time with like 8 weeks notice, and maintained throughout the planning that he would be taking off at noon to help me.\n\nPrior to the show, my boyfriend did patiently listen to me talk about the show, and he went with me week of the show to hang my work. While this was very kind of him to do, he was REALLY sullen on the way there because we took my (completely cleaned out) car, and he felt like he was “just a pair of hands” because he didn’t drive? I love when he drives, but his car is stuffed with large items. I thought it would have been rude of me to ask, while we were rushing, to say hey clean out your car and let's move 30 frames from my car to yours AND drive me 50 min each way. He apologized for his mood/responses and said he’d had a tough day at work, and we both listened to one another, and moved on to hanging items and having supper. All was well.\n\nThe day before the show rolls around, and he mentions he has a phone screen for a potential new job right smack dab at the exact time we need to leave our house to set up the show. I am a bit disappointed, but I shrug it off because he has been unhappy in his role for some time, and I want to support him finding a new job where he will be happier. He says he will just do the phone screen, then hop in the car to meet my sister and I and help. I asked if he still planned to do the half day and he said yes.\n\nNow, here is where I may have failed in my communication (and him too!) I assumed this meant that he still planned to leave work around noon (4 min commute) and then he’d do lunch with us, help out, then retreat into the office to do his phone call while we scooted out at 3, and he’d follow when he finished around 3:30. So the day comes, and I sent him some good luck texts about the call. I don’t hear anything, but assume he’s probably prepping. My sister and I have a good time eating, packing, getting ready, etc. I don’t hear anything from him still, it’s now 3. So I tell him hey, we will leave some items we couldn’t fit, he responds to say he will get them.\n\nWe had an early dinner reservation at 4:45 to make it to the show on time, 4:15 rolls around and no word. Finally as supper is starting he calls and says hey, I’m actually just leaving now, crazy day at work and the phone screen got moved. It's a 50 min drive.\n\nI went downstairs and told my family hey, he’s not coming to dinner. They were surprised but didn’t say much. They love him, but I think they have noticed he’s often just very late, which isn’t great.\n\nHe gets there right at 6, I had gotten him to go food he ordered from our supper, and I kind of pushed it down to focus on this show. It was a big deal to me, and tons of family, friends, coworkers showed. It was a wonderful, successful night. We were hosting people this weekend all weekend, so I haven’t brought it up. I texted him and told him I want to talk about it tonight. I struggle with anxiety and felt a bit anxious about bringing this up.\n\nIf this were a one off, okay fine. I am just disappointed because it is a pattern of him making a commitment to some sort of plan, and then not telling me until way later that it won’t work out. It makes me feel deprioritized. Of course the phone screen was important! But why didn’t he communicate to me that he’d be available hours and hours later, as it was happening? Like hey, I am not going to be doing the half day because work is crazy. Hey, they moved the phone screen. I would feel a lot better about that.\n\nI can think of five or six times off the top of my head that we talk about leaving at a time to go on a trip, or meet up with either of our families, or friends, and we leave HOURS after we planned. I talked to my therapist about it, and she said that maybe to him it’s about controlling time, and not having control of time at work because he always has meetings, but I am just frustrated. I always say what time feels reasonable? And he will say “I will take a half day” then he just won’t ask his boss for it? and it’s a desk job where he schedules client meetings, so he could block off time weeks in advance, or could tell me in advance hey something popped up. It feels like (much longer story for another thread) maybe he’s putting off disappointing me, because his mom reacts badly to disappointment. But I don’t! And I haven’t for 2.5 years, so I don’t want to be treated like I would. We have talked about this before, and he agrees that it wasn't good, and then does it again.\n\nI feel like if I don’t bring this up, I am being a doormat. I don’t want to hold in resentment, I want to communicate. And normally I am so good at communicating my feelings in a really calm way, but I worry that I am SO calm, that people I have dated (including my current boyfriend) don’t recognize how frustrated I am.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for how to word this, or am I giving him too hard of a time? I am trying to word things in a compassionate way that is understanding and also conveys how disappointed I am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to add: Another example of me being a doormat and him just not getting it. He won't turn off his weekday alarm on weekends, so it wakes me up early and I can't go back to sleep. Every time it happens, I'm like hey, that isn't cool, if you aren't planning to get up can you just adjust it or turn it off? I even ask weekend nights hey is your alarm off. He will sometimes say \"yes it's off.\" but it will go off! He didn't even check it. It drives me crazy. I brought it up last night because it happened this weekend both mornings, and I was exhausted from hosting and the show and lifting and prepping, and he seemed annoyed with me for calmly being like hey, seriously, please, this wakes me up and I can't go back to sleep. His response was \"Let's talk about it later. But yeah. It doesn't wake me up to where I can't get back to sleep, so I guess I don't think about it that way. I will try and do better about that.\" Reddit, it takes less than 15 seconds to flip your alarm to Mon - Fri (he works 9-5 mon-fri) and then do your weekend alarm later if you want one, it feels so flippant to not address something that wakes me up 1.5 hours early every weekend morning!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I am coming off really frustrated here. We have a ton of fun and we divide household tasks well, we love spending time together and have a ton in common, and sometimes have some solid communication but I am just speaking to these recent experiences.\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend said he would help with my first ever big art show. Didn't communicate to me for hours and showed up after prepping, setup, and family dinner. I need to communicate this to him but am struggling with if it is fair of me, or how to, because it was partly due to him having an opportunity pop up.","author_fullname":"t2_3uflt4ue","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Me (29F) with my boyfriend of 2.5 years (31M) didn't help me set up, didn't really communicate, and missed dinner the day of my very first gallery show.","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationships","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"m-vt relationships","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_fcl5tb","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":66,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Relationships","can_mod_post":false,"score":66,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":1583192229,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1583220423,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.relationships","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi folks.

It has been turbulent. Much of that is to do with some of my unresolved mental issues. When we met I also had a broken heart from a breakup. Looking back, I should have resolved some things before getting into a relationship, but we are here now trying to make it work. \n\nBecause of so much drama that has happened between us, it has definitely caused a strain in things. For example, he did some stuff behind my back for awhile and claims it was because we were not official and he thought it would end anyways. I think I only gave him another chance because of all he has put up with me. He probably has given me more chances because he understands that people are not perfect. \n\nDue to a number of reasons, I have not had a real job in awhile and left college a long time ago, without a degree. He has the condition that I find work/go back to school and also getting therapy, if we are staying together. \nEven though he is in a better place in life, doesn’t seem he wants to improve at all. \n\nFor example, reminding him of hygiene or to do chores. His place has never been very clean in general, which has caused tension in the past. Gaming non stop. I think us seeing each other so often makes it less thought of to do stuff. We did spend a whole day watching movies on a recent weekend and hang out everyday, but most of the time it is rushed because he would rather game. \n\nHe has a weird way of showing affection. The other day he came up behind me and started to hump me. When I asked what he is doing, he said it was a thank you for cleaning up... this left me feeling gross. It was not sex, just how he did it. I told him to be more mindful since I have a history of sexual trauma and he got defensive since he was “joking”. He often does mean jokes. He will lightly graze me down there sometimes and say he is teasing me... for later. It will be like half a second and later never comes. It is in no way seductive or even romantic. We never have romance. \n\nHe is not really the gentleman type and says immature things to his gamer friends. He will annoy me on purpose and say it is out of love. Stuff like that. \n\nI do not think he is that into me. I try to initiate sex and he doesn’t want to. Says he doesn’t know if he is in love with me or if we have ever made love. I know he loves me, but wonder how much better it can get. \n\nI want to and am going to improve myself as a person. He seems perfectly fine with being a life he has now. We have worked on goals, it has not really gone far though. It is like we have been demotivators  for each other. He has some traits that I recognize in myself I am trying to banish. \n\nHe is a lot more charismatic than me, so I think being well liked also makes him think it is only me who needs to improve. I also feel bad because he is not one to point out all my flaws, but I am starting to question things. He said he would not care if I was a slob and overweight, so I end up feeling like I am being too harsh. \n\nNot to compare people, but my ex was super into self improvement and romance, intimacy. He was also a decade older. So I guess I kinda raised my expectations by a lot for some things that may be unrealistic. Prior to that my relationships were very superficial in comparison. The whole point of all this is that it seems he is comfortable with how it is and there is no room for improvement, and I am the only source of our issues. \n\nIf I had not caused so much chaos and destruction between us and had my life together, my expectations would be higher. I am sure he has settled too because a woman with her life together would not put up with some things, just as most people would not put up with me... \n\nAs I am feeling growth inside of me, I worry my standards will change inadvertently and that is not fair when he’s been so accepting of me... (though in some ways he has not been because uninvited me places as punishment for my bad behavior, I.E mental health stuff). \n\nI want the things he has said he will do to come true or to be left alone. For example, he said he’d “formally” ask me out one days months ago, as a romantic gesture. When I brought it up he basically talked it down, even though it would have meant a lot to me. Saying my likes and dislikes and having him notice and want to impress me. It feels like we have been giving one another the bare minimum, but I am afraid to step it up because last time I tried he was doing stuff behind my back, then did it again. So my heart has been closed off and he has not  opened his... I also cut him a lot of slack because he’s not had a girlfriend since high school. Just like he does not judge me as hard for my crappy upbringing. I know he was super supportive of her because she was assaulted, but does not  seem to take my trauma seriously. \n\nHe says I make him happy and stuff when I ask why he wants this. He can never give specific reasons why he likes me because he doesn’t want to be my source of validation. I’m just trying to be close, but that’s always the answer. Sometimes I think he’s just lonely and does not really have strong feelings for me. Even though he shows affection in other ways. I want to fix things and don’t know how. I keep telling him, but he’s not doing anything to show he does. Not even sex, he doesn’t seem into it and has never really been into pleasing me as much as his own pleasure. One time he was blackout drunk and put it in my butt when I repeatedly said no and kept going when I said stop. He said sorry, but then he continued to do stuff that makes me think he does not care. \n\nSome of my good habits have declined since I have been staying with him. If he does not try then why should I? \n\n\nYou could say I am the larger part of the problem in this relationship, but I think a lot of my mood stuff has to do with feeling unheard or unmet in this. Could even say he is  better in relationship, but that is only surface level. It’s lacking depth and I’m not sure he even knows how to do this on a deeper level. We eat together. Have zero passion sex when he feels like it (not even pleasing just me, even if he’s not in the mood - even though I do for him), watch a show. Sleep in the same bed. He will talk about random stuff and it sound like a 7 yr old with adhd said it, but nothing deep. Or try to annoy me on purpose. If he wants to do something sexual and I do not bc he hasn’t washed his hands or his dick smells, he is still pushed me to do it. \n\nWe make goals together, but they are never seen and I do not seem to motivate him because he does not respect me. Why am I the only one seen as toxic and he can do all of this :( even his cheating was “my fault”\n\nSorry for all of this in advance. I want things to work, and just to make it clear I am just as bad, if not worst. I just don’t know how to get out of the rut of both of us settling for what this is rn. I don’t know how to call him out and have him hear me and not get defensive or turn it around (“you’re not my mom”, “focus on yourself”, etc) \n\nI think a lot of this has been building up for me as I feel big changes happening within me, as in growth. I do not want to hate on someone I love when he can hold so much against me, but I need to know how to get the point across that he has issues too. I keep asking if he is sad and stuff and he just acts like all is fine. I want to help for him and me. If I wrote everything I have done down, you guys would tell him to dump me too. This is also insight for me because I thought maybe my expectations were too high. Overall he is nice, buys me food, and we hang out everyday. I’m probably just being PMS... \n\nHe does not seem to get that a lot of how I am is because of him. But then he will say that he’s not trying as hard because of me. \n\nIt is hard not to blame myself when I am seen as the bad guy by his friends and family and he’s loved and well received by mine. I know he’s trying, but something is missing. \n\nTLDR: Need bf to step it up when I do. I do not  want to breakup and am not trying to make him look bad. I am very childish in this relationship and we both have room to grow. If I highlighted everything bad about me, you guys would say the same things. \n\nI just want him to take me into his arms and tell me things are changing for the better and he loves me. \n\nEDIT: Can not sleep, so sorry if this is discombobulated.

It has been turbulent. Much of that is to do with some of my unresolved mental issues. When we met I also had a broken heart from a breakup. Looking back, I should have resolved some things before getting into a relationship, but we are here now trying to make it work. </p>\n\n<p>Because of so much drama that has happened between us, it has definitely caused a strain in things. For example, he did some stuff behind my back for awhile and claims it was because we were not official and he thought it would end anyways. I think I only gave him another chance because of all he has put up with me. He probably has given me more chances because he understands that people are not perfect. </p>\n\n<p>Due to a number of reasons, I have not had a real job in awhile and left college a long time ago, without a degree. He has the condition that I find work/go back to school and also getting therapy, if we are staying together. \nEven though he is in a better place in life, doesn’t seem he wants to improve at all. </p>\n\n<p>For example, reminding him of hygiene or to do chores. His place has never been very clean in general, which has caused tension in the past. Gaming non stop. I think us seeing each other so often makes it less thought of to do stuff. We did spend a whole day watching movies on a recent weekend and hang out everyday, but most of the time it is rushed because he would rather game. </p>\n\n<p>He has a weird way of showing affection. The other day he came up behind me and started to hump me. When I asked what he is doing, he said it was a thank you for cleaning up... this left me feeling gross. It was not sex, just how he did it.

She was always part of my life and every Friday for every week of my life, I would always go to her house to spend the night with my grandparents. We would usually go to a grocery store, eat dinner, and watch Wheel of Fortune together at their house until it was time for bed. It wasn't anything huge or overwhelmingly what people might considered \"fun\" but it meant something to me. She was the type of person that made absolutely anything and everything fun- Even going down every aisle to look at food was fun with her. \n\nShe got dementia sometime in 2014 and moved someplace else that could better suit her needs. She was arthritic, but surprisingly mobile given her condition, and would often wander away without proper supervision- therefore- grocery stores weren't something she could really enjoy anymore. But I always just kind of liked them because...Idk they just give me positive feelings. \n\nShe passed away last year after 5 years of battling with her arthritis and dementia- And I guess I never really coped well.

She was always part of my life and every Friday for every week of my life, I would always go to her house to spend the night with my grandparents. We would usually go to a grocery store, eat dinner, and watch Wheel of Fortune together at their house until it was time for bed. It wasn&#39;t anything huge or overwhelmingly what people might considered &quot;fun&quot; but it meant something to me.

But I can't do the same for her any more.\n\nA bit of back story, growing up we lived with my grandparents, her parents, and my late great grandmother (my other rock). My relationship with my grandparents at the time was abusive. They were mad at my mom for various reasons and took that out on myself and my older brother, as a result my older brother was hardly (never) around. I don't want to go into too much detail about their abuse, I just want to highlight the financial part of it cause I think it pertains to my current situation. My grandparents would take money from my mom, they straight up nickled and dimed her for everything, constantly accused her of not paying enough, changing the amounts of what was due each month, bullied my brother to drop out college cause \"it's a waste of money\" and told him to get a job so he can contribute and nickled and dined him too till he moved out. I was starting high school during this time. They would take my lunch money that my mom gave me cause \"she owed them money\" but some how had enough money to buy a large RV and to pave a second drive way with gaudy gates for said RV. Later found out they remortgage the house to afford it.\nJump cut to 2011 during my first year at a CC we lost my grandfather, great grandmother, and one of my aunts. We also lost our home to foreclosure. So mom and I stay in our apt. And my grand mother stays in an 55+ housing community. After moving around between the two homes a couple times (granma didn't want to live alone and my bro would live with us in between spots)\n\nFrom my knowledge, by 2015 was where the problems started. My bro was living in San Diego, I was living with mom, and my gma at her place. But my bro was still paying rent to my mom since he would be with us during the week. It was a weird set up where he had two jobs one by us and the other in SD. \n\nBy 2016 my mom is laid off, and my bro moves back home. This entire time I've been paying my share of rent, or at the time what I thought was my share, and my finances was tied with my moms for some reason. I wasn't really financially literate at the time and assumed me being broke all the time was due to my low paying job. During 2016 I started budgeting and noticed my mom was taking my money. I started noticing this cause she would refer to my money as hers. So I got my own account, switched my phone to a different carrier, and got my own car insurance. \n\nBy 2017, my brother is quickly fed up w/ how much he's spending on rent and moves out. This left me with paying the full amount of rent, my own Bill's and my moms Bill's. Now she did get a severance package but till this day I'm not sure where that money went. I dont know if it went to MLMs or all these licences (insurance and real estate) that she claims she needs. But basically that money vanished. She also decided she didn't want to work in the career she was in anymore and wanted to sell insurance and real estate.\n\nIn 2017 I went into debt trying to keep us afloat. I maxed out my two credit cards, took out loans from check cashing places, with her urging/advise. All cause we can't move cause her credit is shot and the only reason we have the place we do is cause it's in my brother's name. (To the absolute frustration of my brother) I had a car in her name, again with her help and urgency cause I didn't know about 1st time buyer loans. I had fell behind in payments cause I had to choose between paying the car note or rent. During all this I was struggling mentally and dealing with events that occurred during 2016 and with financial struggles. At this time my uncle (her brother) was trying to convince me to move out and save myself but I didn't cause the thought of my mom being homeless and on the street makes my blood run cold. Till this day that's how I feel about it.\n\nShe gets a job in her old field by the end of 2017 but it's not working out for her. At this time I was having difficulties with my job as well. By 2018, my car died cause I didn't have enough money to pay for maintenance since all my money went to my phone (needed for work) and rent. At some point I even let the insurance slip and wasn't caught up on registration. I just never had the money. I then got a new job closer to home that paid a bit more (went from 13/hr to 15.50/hr) and with help from my uncle and my brother I got a new car in my name. Two months into my new job, my mom gets fired from her job. And since then I've been covering rent and my Bill's and everything again. I told her this time I wasn't going to go through this again with her and she needed to look for a job asap no more mlm bullshit. But I feel like now I have a worse problem, she's stuck on this insurance thing. She wants to sell insurance so what ever chunk of money she does get, it goes to keeping up her licenses for insurance first. They even have her driving everywhere to these meetings and stuff. But she's not making any money from it. She has like 1 sell every 4 months, and she only makes 400 from that one sell. But after every meeting she comes back excited and gushing bout how she met this person or group that's going to help her sell better or pay like 4000 for every person that signs up for the insurance, or both. And it just sounds like a mlm but she swears its not and this how you sell insurance federally.\n\nSo from then till now, I've been spending my whole check on making sure we don't get evicted. I've again, with out paying off my other loans due to not having enough money too, got another loan to cover rent back in sept. \n\nI've switched jobs again cause I want to move towards the career I'm trying to study for (it's hard when I can't even afford school) and my job isn't close to home anymore. I had to borrow money from my uncle to pay her share of the Bill's (cause she cant ask him for money cause she owes him and everyone else for that matter a whole lot of money) and I've been paying him back up till now where I had to ask him for an amount of money that I still cant figure out how I'm gonna pay back. And I tried, knowing that it would be a hail Mary, to save both my checks in full for rent but I couldn't cause I still need gas and/or train money to get to work. I have most of the rent, were short 400, was 200 but I guess I miss heard her when she told me she gets 200/wk for un employment. I seem to miss hear her a lot some how.\n\nI tried and still trying to sell my things to come up with the money for rent and to pay back my uncle. I'm checking what freelance things I could do, I'm trying to find solutions.\n\nMy mom on the other hand, took my car to San Diego for an insurance meeting while I was at work, spent I'm assuming 200 on the whole trip cause I needed air in my tires and oil (I know this but I don't have the money for it, I'm focused on rent) and just in general does shit like that. Any time any body tries to explain or talking to her bout what she's doing and not doing she just shuts down. She starts crying and snapping at us, asking what more she can do, asking what we expect her to do, claiming she is looking for a job by reaching out to her agencies but they're not helping, then turn it on us and saying were not helping and she does this and that to help us (like taking care of my tires and oil and buying food[sugary drinks, lunch meat, and sausage] going with my grandmother to the dr.) But when we tell her it still spending money we don't have she asks for that money back from us. And she guilt trips us for not supporting her.\n\nI'm emotionally worn out. On one hand, I cant stomache the thought of her being homeless but on the other hand sometimes...I can't even type it out. Basically, I'm starting to hate her and I can't think of any other way to help her. I'm no longer sympathetic, and I don't know how to be supportive anymore. I can't even be supportive when she tells me bout the interviews she has lined up. Cause she always has interviews lined up and nothing comes from it. I just feel nothing but stress. How do I be supportive again?\n\nThis was already long so I want add some additional info: \n\n• My mom doesn't have a car, so she uses mine to get around when I let her. Or she uses my grandmother's car. Her car died a long time ago but she refuses to get rid of it cause its fully paid off. My grandmother gave her a second car but that needs to be repaired.\n\n•My bro and I are the main two bringing in money but I'm the one bringing in the most money so far. This is cause my bro is still getting back on his feet after a major motorcycle accident he was in back 2018. We're still waiting on the payout for that. Not for us, for him. (And hope to god my mom doesn't get her hands on any of it)\n\n•My bro during his recovery is staying with my grandmother if that matters.\n\n•My uncle is pretty much rich and helps out my grandmother, my brother, and myself when he can. Him and mom have a bad relationship.\n\n•Due to their bad relationship he will let her be homeless. But he will house me if I need it.\n\n•My other aunt (moms sister) has been nomading this whole time and just came back home, currently staying with my uncle and is helping me sell my things.\n\n•I've been wanting to move out since 2014 but didn't cause I thought I didn't make enough and when I realized I did make enough I had to help out my mom.\n\n•I am planning on moving out as soon as my probation is up at my new job. So by april.\n\nI know this is all over the place but I skipped over a lot and didn't really know how to connect everything. Kind of hard to figure out what the essential information is. \n\nTL;DR my mom sucks with finances and I'm going broke and deep in debt to keep her from homelessness. Wondering how else to help her without hating her.\n\nSorry for all spelling and grammar mistakes, I typed this out on my phone.","author_fullname":"t2_dn2md","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"I (27f) am running out of ways to help my mother (53f) and I fear I might start to hate her.","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationships","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"new","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_fc8rhp","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":40,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"[new]","can_mod_post":false,"score":40,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":1583135698,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1583164279,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.relationships","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Im not sure if this the right place to post this.</p>\n\n<p>To start, my mom and I had a wonderful relationship growing up and she&#39;s been there for me when I really needed her during trying times.

I&#39;ve again, with out paying off my other loans due to not having enough money too, got another loan to cover rent back in sept. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve switched jobs again cause I want to move towards the career I&#39;m trying to study for (it&#39;s hard when I can&#39;t even afford school) and my job isn&#39;t close to home anymore. I had to borrow money from my uncle to pay her share of the Bill&#39;s (cause she cant ask him for money cause she owes him and everyone else for that matter a whole lot of money) and I&#39;ve been paying him back up till now where I had to ask him for an amount of money that I still cant figure out how I&#39;m gonna pay back. And I tried, knowing that it would be a hail Mary, to save both my checks in full for rent but I couldn&#39;t cause I still need gas and/or train money to get to work. I have most of the rent, were short 400, was 200 but I guess I miss heard her when she told me she gets 200/wk for un employment. I seem to miss hear her a lot some how.</p>\n\n<p>I tried and still trying to sell my things to come up with the money for rent and to pay back my uncle. I&#39;m checking what freelance things I could do, I&#39;m trying to find solutions.</p>\n\n<p>My mom on the other hand, took my car to San Diego for an insurance meeting while I was at work, spent I&#39;m assuming 200 on the whole trip cause I needed air in my tires and oil (I know this but I don&#39;t have the money for it, I&#39;m focused on rent) and just in general does shit like that. Any time any body tries to explain or talking to her bout what she&#39;s doing and not doing she just shuts down. She starts crying and snapping at us, asking what more she can do, asking what we expect her to do, claiming she is looking for a job by reaching out to her agencies but they&#39;re not helping, then turn it on us and saying were not helping and she does this and that to help us (like taking care of my tires and oil and buying food[sugary drinks, lunch meat, and sausage] going with my grandmother to the dr.) But when we tell her it still spending money we don&#39;t have she asks for that money back from us. And she guilt trips us for not supporting her.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m emotionally worn out. On one hand, I cant stomache the thought of her being homeless but on the other hand sometimes...I can&#39;t even type it out. Basically, I&#39;m starting to hate her and I can&#39;t think of any other way to help her. I&#39;m no longer sympathetic, and I don&#39;t know how to be supportive anymore. I can&#39;t even be supportive when she tells me bout the interviews she has lined up. Cause she always has interviews lined up and nothing comes from it. I just feel nothing but stress. How do I be supportive again?</p>\n\n<p>This was already long so I want add some additional info: </p>\n\n<p>• My mom doesn&#39;t have a car, so she uses mine to get around when I let her. Or she uses my grandmother&#39;s car. Her car died a long time ago but she refuses to get rid of it cause its fully paid off. My grandmother gave her a second car but that needs to be repaired.</p>\n\n<p>•My bro and I are the main two bringing in money but I&#39;m the one bringing in the most money so far. This is cause my bro is still getting back on his feet after a major motorcycle accident he was in back 2018. We&#39;re still waiting on the payout for that. Not for us, for him. (And hope to god my mom doesn&#39;t get her hands on any of it)</p>\n\n<p>•My bro during his recovery is staying with my grandmother if that matters.</p>\n\n<p>•My uncle is pretty much rich and helps out my grandmother, my brother, and myself when he can. Him and mom have a bad relationship.</p>\n\n<p>•Due to their bad relationship he will let her be homeless. But he will house me if I need it.</p>\n\n<p>•My other aunt (moms sister) has been nomading this whole time and just came back home, currently staying with my uncle and is helping me sell my things.</p>\n\n<p>•I&#39;ve been wanting to move out since 2014 but didn&#39;t cause I thought I didn&#39;t make enough and when I realized I did make enough I had to help out my mom.</p>\n\n<p>•I am planning on moving out as soon as my probation is up at my new job. So by april.</p>\n\n<p>I know this is all over the place but I skipped over a lot and didn&#39;t really know how to connect everything. Kind of hard to figure out what the essential information is. </p>\n\n<p>TL;DR my mom sucks with finances and I&#39;m going broke and deep in debt to keep her from homelessness. Wondering how else to help her without hating her.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for all spelling and grammar mistakes, I typed this out on my phone.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fc8rhp","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Viindictive","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":20,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fc8rhp/i_27f_am_running_out_of_ways_to_help_my_mother/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fc8rhp/i_27f_am_running_out_of_ways_to_help_my_mother/","subreddit_subscribers":2795086,"created_utc":1583135479,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},"fek07k":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"We were having an argument, and the fact that being around people on a constant basis is mentally draining for me got brought up.

I study sociology on a general branch which means I get to learn about sociology in general, because of my good grades I have been given opportunities with my school to replace class time with internships and receive school credit that my scholarship can expand towards. This is a super cool opportunity, only two students in my uni have this.\n\nI intern at a professional wrestling company. It's super cool, everyone is very sweet to me. I have acquired the position of media and light effects which turns out I'm very good at, I enjoy it. I get to read about Sports Sociology and that is what my end of semester report will reflect.\n\nAll of this sounds something to be proud of right?\n\nWell, **I met my boyfriend here.** *He (23M) is a professional wrestler, I am the intern of the company.* When we first started dating, the CEO told us he supported it. My boyfriend has been training with his company since he was 15 and so the CEO knew he didn't have ill intent in getting to know me. He did as **we be discreet.**\n\nand we have, so far until this week. Before matches, he always comes to me in backstage lights area and says hi, gives me a kiss or two. But at yesterday's match he could not stop. He went for a kiss and did those non stop kisses that **are so cute in private.**\n\nDuring intermission, I went to an area where his father usually sits at with his girlfriend. He asked his dad to take a picture of us and on the second shot he kissed me for the pic. Everyone was watching us and looked away because at that point it was akward.\n\nI texted him when matches begun again that I was limiting him to one kiss at the internship.I tried to talk to him about it and he just said that's what his mother would do, pull way from his dad before they divorced. I explained that it's not like I'm not affectionate at home or when we are out and about but this is a little different. I wanted us to be discreet at the events.\n\nHis response was that he would from now on not talk to me and avoid me. I was hurt by this because I wanted to come to a resolution where he would too feel comfortable. but instead he just said, I was tired and I should go. He then asked if I was going to spend the weekend and spring break with him to which I said no. If he didn't want to resolve our problems by just not talking to me then there was no point in going.\n\nHe is a great man, he is good to me. I don't think I'm in the wrong but his response said otherwise. I don't really know how to approach this situation. I don't get a lot of attention from other wrestlers with the exception of friendly greetings. I just don't know how to talk to him about it.\n\nI tried being kind, I started explaining myself by telling him how much he meant to me, how hard I worked for the internship and how we are happy. but still, he just said it will take a while for him to conform to not kissing all over the events. Even if that's something we haven't done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR!- I met my boyfriend at an entertainment internship. He won't stop showing PDA, I asked him to stop and now we are not talking.\n\nUpdate: \nYes my boyfriend is a huge hunky muscle man but he’s also a very sweet, intelligent individual. He contacted me once I left school and we spoke. He apologized, owned up to reacting based on emotion and we set a greeting kiss limit at the events, backstage or out of premises for work hours. \n\nThe change in behavior was due to locker room talk from other wrestlers comments on my looks. That fed a little ego to my otherwise humble man.

I get to read about Sports Sociology and that is what my end of semester report will reflect.</p>\n\n<p>All of this sounds something to be proud of right?</p>\n\n<p>Well, <strong>I met my boyfriend here.</strong> <em>He (23M) is a professional wrestler, I am the intern of the company.</em> When we first started dating, the CEO told us he supported it. My boyfriend has been training with his company since he was 15 and so the CEO knew he didn&#39;t have ill intent in getting to know me. He did as <strong>we be discreet.</strong></p>\n\n<p>and we have, so far until this week. Before matches, he always comes to me in backstage lights area and says hi, gives me a kiss or two. But at yesterday&#39;s match he could not stop. He went for a kiss and did those non stop kisses that <strong>are so cute in private.</strong></p>\n\n<p>During intermission, I went to an area where his father usually sits at with his girlfriend. He asked his dad to take a picture of us and on the second shot he kissed me for the pic. Everyone was watching us and looked away because at that point it was akward.</p>\n\n<p>I texted him when matches begun again that I was limiting him to one kiss at the internship.I tried to talk to him about it and he just said that&#39;s what his mother would do, pull way from his dad before they divorced. I explained that it&#39;s not like I&#39;m not affectionate at home or when we are out and about but this is a little different. I wanted us to be discreet at the events.</p>\n\n<p>His response was that he would from now on not talk to me and avoid me. I was hurt by this because I wanted to come to a resolution where he would too feel comfortable. but instead he just said, I was tired and I should go. He then asked if I was going to spend the weekend and spring break with him to which I said no. If he didn&#39;t want to resolve our problems by just not talking to me then there was no point in going.</p>\n\n<p>He is a great man, he is good to me. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m in the wrong but his response said otherwise. I don&#39;t really know how to approach this situation. I don&#39;t get a lot of attention from other wrestlers with the exception of friendly greetings. I just don&#39;t know how to talk to him about it.</p>\n\n<p>I tried being kind, I started explaining myself by telling him how much he meant to me, how hard I worked for the internship and how we are happy. but still, he just said it will take a while for him to conform to not kissing all over the events. Even if that&#39;s something we haven&#39;t done.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR!- I met my boyfriend at an entertainment internship. He won&#39;t stop showing PDA, I asked him to stop and now we are not talking.</p>\n\n<p>Update: \nYes my boyfriend is a huge hunky muscle man but he’s also a very sweet, intelligent individual. He contacted me once I left school and we spoke. He apologized, owned up to reacting based on emotion and we set a greeting kiss limit at the events, backstage or out of premises for work hours. </p>\n\n<p>The change in behavior was due to locker room talk from other wrestlers comments on my looks. That fed a little ego to my otherwise humble man. All of y’all had great advice so thank you for taking time of your day, and thank you for your insight!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fek2fw","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"cosyd","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":32,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fek2fw/i_asked_my_boyfriend_to_stop_kissing_me_so_much/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fek2fw/i_asked_my_boyfriend_to_stop_kissing_me_so_much/","subreddit_subscribers":2795086,"created_utc":1583528186,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},"fe6kz0":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"It’s a little long, there’s a lot of backstory here and I apologize for that.\n\nSo this isn’t just a recent thing going on. A bit of backstory: my parents raised us to believe that we *had* to go to college. There was no other choice for us, no one would hire us otherwise, we’d live in poverty, this was the only way etc etc. They didn’t even tell us that we had college funds until late high school, and because of this my brother and I dealt with this anxiety they gifted us in different ways. He worked his ass off throughout high school, President of the National honors society, solo songs in the yearly musical production our school was known for, basically everything you can imagine to do well as the perfect student, he did. I on the other hand was shy, and with an undiagnosed case of ADD (that I therefore of course received no help with), I would make decent grades with an above average GPA, but still they would always compare me negatively to him. It felt like I was living in his shadow.\n\nI was treated differently in many respects. On my brothers 17th birthday they gifted him a laptop, when my 17th birthday came around I had expected one, but didn’t get one. They used punishment methods on me (taking away electronics, computer time, what have you, anything I liked) when with him it was a reward system. I would say to them that it was unfair and they’d basically throw the grades and extra curriculars back in my face and say that that was why. \n\nLittle things bothered me too growing up, like how when he had a baseball game or orchestra concert or anything the whole family had to be in attendance. When I had a cross country meet or an art show I usually got one parent to come. Sometimes two, but usually just one. They never made him go to my things, and all of this left me with a feeling of not being valued as much. I would say it’s unfair and they would say “life’s not fair”, and point out his accomplishments. And mine always seemed minuscule and like let-downs in comparison.\n\nShit I just remembered, in high school parents could buy pages in the yearbook and dedicate them to their kids, my brother got one when he was a senior, and he didn’t really appreciate the photos they chose to use. So a couple years later when my senior yearbook came out I was excited looking in the back of the book for my page, but there wasn’t one. When I asked my mother why she said “well your brother said he didn’t like his, so we didn’t want to waste money buying one for you in case you didn’t like yours.” So without saying anything to me, they just didn’t.\n\nSo after he graduated high school he got a full ride scholarship to a really good college in the area. My parents were ecstatic, and then they did something I still find so stupid even from an objective standpoint, they gave him -an 18 year old boy fresh out of high school- his entire college fund to spend at his leisure. He ended up taking an expensive trip with his then-girlfriend, and blowing the entire thing. \nSo imagine my parents shock when a couple years into college he lost his scholarship (this is important). \n\nHe ended up graduating, but not doing anything with his major as he had decided he wanted to pursue his craft, working in shops and things and within the last couple years he moved in with his much older, more financially stable girlfriend, who helps him financially way more than he contributes (not a speculation on my part, she and I have talked, but I digress). A few months back he quit his last shop job and started his own business out of their home.\n\nNow I myself did get into a college, got a small scholarship but it was zilch in comparison to his full ride. I worked through school (got diagnosed with ADD, big life realization for me as I had always worried that my parents telling me I was “just lazy” was true). I graduated, worked a casual job for a bit until I finally got a nice decently-paying job that my parents were proud of me for having. I would be lying if I said part of this wasn’t probably me trying to be the star child for once- but for once, I actually was. I was doing everything right at least, I had a good job with a retirement plan and benefits and everything, and they have even stressed to me that I should NOT quit it... even though it has been mentally and emotionally destroying me for the last few years and I have told them so. I recently moved into an apartment but housing costs are so high around the area that I’m barely breaking even and I have cried to my mother about this multiple times. She listens and says I can move back in with them for $300 a month which may be my only choice soon based on how things are looking.\n\nSo now that we’re caught up, the other night I was hanging out with my brother and somehow the topic of student loans came up, he started to say “yea but my pa-“ then stopped himself. I asked that he continue and he basically told me that they told him not to tell me, but they had been paying his student loans, not all of them he said, but for a while now.\n\nLet me tell you. I pay for this apartment now. I pay for the extra add on bills that come with that, that I’ve also mentioned to my mother before, about how much it all is. But also I have student loans that I have been paying since I got out of school. Never once did they offer to help (and I know that’s why they told him not to tell me). Not any of the times I was crying about my savings diminishing, not once. On top of that, I have car payments each month because they did gift me one car, my grandmothers that died after about 2-3 years of me having it, hence me having to buy my own.\nThey have given him two perfectly functioning cars, one that he destroyed and another that he is still driving today, absolutely free.\n\nAnd I feel like I sound spoiled complaining. I know so many people’s parental situations are so much worse. But deep down it’s not about the money or gifts or whatever for me, it’s about the lack of equality. When we were young they could use “he got better grades!” as an excuse to treat him better I guess, but now look at the situation. I am using my degree like they wanted, have a good job like they wanted, and honestly don’t ask for a lot (and my parents don’t usually provide a lot either, if my mother gives me a $5 bill for me to  use to do laundry she asks that I immediately paypal her back. And I do.)\n\nAnd my brother is not using his scholarship, he is living practically by the good graces of his girlfriend who is basically providing him housing and a workspace, just started a business and barely knows what saving is (I’ve told him to get Mint a thousand times, he doesn’t listen, he does enjoy purchasing beer/marijuana though with whatever money he does have despite owing me $300 for a year now). (Also by the way I do love my brother very much despite what I say maybe sounding like complaints or criticisms, it’s more me trying the give the facts of our situations).\n\nSo in this world where I worked my way to the “top” (either subconsciously or consciously I really can’t say) to finally do everything “right” according to their standards, they still are giving him things that they don’t give me. Still offering to help him where they wouldn’t offer to help me. And hearing about the student loans last night, I wasn’t in the least bit surprised. And that hurt. It felt like no matter what I did I would never be as worthy of their love as he was. It was never fair, never even close to fair, and it still isn’t even when our situations are reversed.\n\nNow I don’t know what to do. I know my mother and I feel like if I bring this up to her she will either lie, tell me I’m unappreciative of all they have given me, or say it’s because he is in a “tough spot right now” where I’m not (a spot that he chose to put himself in, when I am stressed at work all the time but I tough it out because that’s what they’ve told me to do).\n\nI want to distance myself from them at least emotionally but my mother just got diagnosed in the very very early stages of breast cancer (so probably safe but still could turn serious), and I see them often because my packages and mail still get delivered to their house, and if I don’t find much more affordable housing by June I may have to move back in with them. Where they’ll charge me $300 rent to live in my childhood bedroom where my boyfriend isn’t allowed to spend the night.\n\nPlease help. I don’t want to feel this way but since I learned it I’ve just felt a bit emptier. All of those situations from my past just rose to the forefront of my mind again and it has really been hurting me.\n\nAny advice is appreciated. Thank you.\n\nTL;DR - Recently got a reminder that my parents who have always shown favoritism toward my brother probably still do. Spent the past few years trying to prove that I am as good as he is and I feel heartbroken that this is the way things still are.

(TLDR below the story)  \n\n\nSo, I know this is a problem and I don't know how to really solve it so that is why I am coming here, because I have completely ran out of ideas on how to separate myself from her, (Yes, I know I could up and leave, but I cant draw myself to that.) But every time that I want to try and do things outside of living in the basement of the house I grew up in (Its the only place she rarely goes and has become my sanctuary from her.) Now, don't get me wrong, I love my mother and my family, as we are a fairly close family unit, but its starting to get almost narcissistic how much she wants to control of my life, I found a program where I could learn and earn a culinary certification, and well I had pursued it and made almost books of plans, I knew how much money I would need, what apartment I was going to live in, how much money I would have and I showed her this, and she has told me time and time again to \"pray on it\" So, I did, and I had MORE doors open for me, I found exactly everything I needed, except for money. Which was the only thing I needed to literally move on with my life and learn something that I wanted to do, and was excited for. As I was planning all this, she fell and broke her leg, (which as of writing this she has nearly fully recovered other than some residual pain) And so, Instead of walking out the door of my house in two weeks, I stayed, and became further entrapped in her web of controlling my life.

(TLDR below the story)  </p>\n\n<p>So, I know this is a problem and I don&#39;t know how to really solve it so that is why I am coming here, because I have completely ran out of ideas on how to separate myself from her, (Yes, I know I could up and leave, but I cant draw myself to that.) But every time that I want to try and do things outside of living in the basement of the house I grew up in (Its the only place she rarely goes and has become my sanctuary from her.) Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I love my mother and my family, as we are a fairly close family unit, but its starting to get almost narcissistic how much she wants to control of my life, I found a program where I could learn and earn a culinary certification, and well I had pursued it and made almost books of plans, I knew how much money I would need, what apartment I was going to live in, how much money I would have and I showed her this, and she has told me time and time again to &quot;pray on it&quot; So, I did, and I had MORE doors open for me, I found exactly everything I needed, except for money. Which was the only thing I needed to literally move on with my life and learn something that I wanted to do, and was excited for. As I was planning all this, she fell and broke her leg, (which as of writing this she has nearly fully recovered other than some residual pain) And so, Instead of walking out the door of my house in two weeks, I stayed, and became further entrapped in her web of controlling my life. So for the next 3 months after she fell I drove her where she needed, did all the chores, settled up EVERY debt she thought I owed to her (Included painting the kitchen and various other fairly large tasks) And after getting the report that she is well into her recovery I went to pick up where I left off and started planning, but once again, the joy of getting to do something on my own has been completely killed off by her wanting me to do things, bargaining with me EVERY DAY to not go, giving me HUGE sob stories with tears, choking up and many other things everything from using a &quot;Deal&quot; I verbally said to her OVER 8 YEARS ago, where I wouldn&#39;t move to the city, because we were going to settle my grandmothers estate and I would take up the family farm (Note, its STILL not settled and I&#39;ve grown cold of this as well) And uses everything she can to go against me moving, even me wanting to go to job fairs she DEMANDS I turn on the tracking app and give her a full itinerary of where I am going and what I am going to be doing, where I will be, so on and so on.

She is sobbing day and night for last two days, my mother and father are both worried and not even eating because of her situation. I told my mother some random non related reason of her situation and told the truth to my father. He is denying it even now but I know the truth.\n\nComplete story:\n\nMy father was born in a distant village in India. His ancestor family was jobless and didn't work and live miserable life even though they could work.\nThis made my father to work in factories and as manual labour along side his studies to make the two ends meet for the family at his childhood. He did study well and top his school rankings. He has total 6 sisters and brothers along with patents. Needless to say all of their education, marriage, healthcare,etc were taken care of by my father without expecting a payback. This made him live a life full of sacrifices. Most of his brothers and sisters wasted all his efforts and are not doing anything even now[all of them are above 40 in age].He is at very reputed government job at senior position now. He is very intelligent and seen all low phases of life one could imagine. No one has ever returned/provided any emotional support or even financial support even at his worst of times.\nHe still helps everyone along family line while taking care of us, his immediate family.\nNow, coming to my mother, she had a similar past as my father but she has no education after class 8(middle school).\nThey got married when both of their family poverty was high, and in India arranged marriages is the most popular way of getting married. Taking the family out of miseries and poverty was the only goal of my parents at that time. My mother is never on the same page when we discuss something and lacks communication skills for outer world. But we love her and she cares for us. She is a homemaker.\nBut marriage is beyond just homemaking and caring. My father never got the emotional or financial support from her, she is like a child most of the time and my father can be seen counseling her like a therapist. My father takes care of my mother and loves her.\nNow coming to the relationship of my sister and father, my sister worships my father like a god and my father loves her the most. He can't see her crying and talk and play with her as if she is still 2 years old.\nThis incident of finding out about my father has completely destroyed the innocense of my sister.\n\nI know my father will never divorce my mother as he knows this will lead my mother to take emotional decisions and she has nowhere to go. Also divorce in India is a taboo, I think divorce rate is only close to 1-2%\nAnd this being the case that my elder sister is already married, divorce of her parents will only bring shame in the name of family, which my father will never do. He still takes care of everyone.\n\nThe woman he is having an affair with is very educated and social and I can feel why he might have took this step in the first place. They are having this for about 15 years, she is like her second wife. An affair cannot be justified no matter what.\n\nI am writing here as I am best at giving emotional support to anyone but worst at receiving support. \nI am working now in a good MNC company but I have resigned and will be jobless within a month. I am preparing for government job exams which are going to be scheduled in 2-3 months. In this time I cannot afford my mind to distract at anything but to prepare for my exams.\nI am continuously counseling my sister but I really don't know what exactly should be done as this affair is best hidden for now. In 2-3 years even I will be married, I don't know what will happen if this comes out then. In India, a son is supposed to take care of his parents even after his marriage and live with them in the same house. I love my parents and I know apart from this, there is no flaw in my father, he is the most caring person I ever know and he still loves my mother. He needs emotional support and someone of his level to talk to, but is the affair justified? And why is that woman doing this? Her life seems to be fine. He is a patient of diabetes and blood pressure, I don't how well will he take it if I confront him. \nI blame both my mother and my father for this situation, but ours is a very happy family and a very reputed one in the whole hometown. All of our relatives even the distant ones look up to us for suggestions/advices and give our example to their children to be like us and be like our family.\nI don't know what to do,how to tackle my sister,she is way too emotional, and I am someone who never lets my emotions out, never shared about my emotions with anyone,not even to my close friends, so suggest something please.\n\nTl;dr : My father is having an affair but he loves my mother and will not divorce her no matter what.

A while back he discovered Tiktok and soon started making his own. It is exactly as cringy as you'd imagine, but in a wholesome kinda way (at first). He mostly just lipsynced to his favorite rock songs. \n\n  \n  However... now he has started making Tiktoks of the family, whether we want that or not. Everywhere we go and every 'moment' has to be recorded in a tiktok. He for example has uploaded a lot where my little sister and my mom are in the video (I am good at evading him for the most part). I told him multiple times that you shouldn't upload videos with people who haven't really agreed, but he thinks it's just a harmless little family memory.  My sister has also started to not really want to be in them but he thinks it's funny and makes her anyway.\n\n  \n  Recently we had a really embarassing moment.

Throw away because I'm not use how to feel about this.\n\nMy (22f) boyfriend (23m) have been together for 3 years. I'm not the type to feel jealously, nor do I like starting fights. However, please hear me out, I felt like I needed to.\n\nWhen we first started dating, he lived 2 hours from me and I would visit him (he was in college at the time and I was taking a break from it). We always had fun and I really enjoyed seeing him. About 2-3 months into the relationship he wouldn't stop talking about a girl he used to sleep with. And I mean wouldn't shut up about her. He would even talk about how cute and sweet she was while I was naked in his bed, 2 hours from home. He constantly was showing me pictures of her and I felt awful about myself, even though they weren't sleeping together anymore. I kept my emotions to myself because I didn't want to seem like a psycho girlfriend. I kept those feelings to myself for a year. Within that time span, he was still talking about her and was still in contact with her.\n\nWhen I was curious about having a threesome, he suggested her and only her and after he said her name, I completely shut down and never brought up the topic again and I no longer have interest.\n\nAfter a year, I finally blow up at him and told him how hurt I was that he was saying those things while with me. I told him I don't ever want to hear about her ever again and I wanted him to stop all contact with her. He stopped. I thought my boundary was very clear after that.\n\nAbout a year later I found out he was still following her on insta and friends on fb. Again, I kept to myself, thinking he'd respect me and my boundary this time. A year past and still following her, but not liking any of her photos. About a month ago I blew up at him again saying he broke that boundary again and that I was really hurt he'd do that. His excuse was (not exact quote as I can't remember, but he actually said something like this) \"I still follow her and my exs/flings cause I hurts me.\" I replied back that if he really wanted to hurt himself then he'd still be following his first love (broke up with him after 2 years and got married 3 months later) and see how happy she is. He changed his excuse to \"I follow them because it makes me happy seeing I'm not with any of them, but with you.\" I told him he doesn't need to see them to be happy and that I should be the one providing him happiness. None the less, follow them if he doesn't like any of their pictures/posts.\n\nIn the end, I asked him to remove them all from social media and proof that he no longer has contact with any of them. I feel horrible for making him do that and I feel like I took it too far, but after all that, I have 0 self-confidence now and I always find myself comparing myself to them, especially the girl he wouldn't shut up about.\n\nAm I wrong for doing this? What should I do? He said he'd do anything to make me happy and get my confidence back, but I feel like he broke a big boundary.\n\nTL;DR my bf made me feel bad about myself because he wouldn't stop talking about how great a girl he slept with was before we started dating. It ended up making me feel self conscious and it caused two bad fights but I feel like an a\\*\\*hole\n\nEdit: thank you for your comments everyone. As much as it hurts, I know what I need to do.

Throw away because I&#39;m not use how to feel about this.</p>\n\n<p>My (22f) boyfriend (23m) have been together for 3 years. I&#39;m not the type to feel jealously, nor do I like starting fights. However, please hear me out, I felt like I needed to.</p>\n\n<p>When we first started dating, he lived 2 hours from me and I would visit him (he was in college at the time and I was taking a break from it). We always had fun and I really enjoyed seeing him. About 2-3 months into the relationship he wouldn&#39;t stop talking about a girl he used to sleep with. And I mean wouldn&#39;t shut up about her. He would even talk about how cute and sweet she was while I was naked in his bed, 2 hours from home. He constantly was showing me pictures of her and I felt awful about myself, even though they weren&#39;t sleeping together anymore. I kept my emotions to myself because I didn&#39;t want to seem like a psycho girlfriend. I kept those feelings to myself for a year. Within that time span, he was still talking about her and was still in contact with her.</p>\n\n<p>When I was curious about having a threesome, he suggested her and only her and after he said her name, I completely shut down and never brought up the topic again and I no longer have interest.</p>\n\n<p>After a year, I finally blow up at him and told him how hurt I was that he was saying those things while with me. I told him I don&#39;t ever want to hear about her ever again and I wanted him to stop all contact with her. He stopped. I thought my boundary was very clear after that.</p>\n\n<p>About a year later I found out he was still following her on insta and friends on fb. Again, I kept to myself, thinking he&#39;d respect me and my boundary this time. A year past and still following her, but not liking any of her photos. About a month ago I blew up at him again saying he broke that boundary again and that I was really hurt he&#39;d do that. His excuse was (not exact quote as I can&#39;t remember, but he actually said something like this) &quot;I still follow her and my exs/flings cause I hurts me.&quot; I replied back that if he really wanted to hurt himself then he&#39;d still be following his first love (broke up with him after 2 years and got married 3 months later) and see how happy she is. He changed his excuse to &quot;I follow them because it makes me happy seeing I&#39;m not with any of them, but with you.&quot; I told him he doesn&#39;t need to see them to be happy and that I should be the one providing him happiness. None the less, follow them if he doesn&#39;t like any of their pictures/posts.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, I asked him to remove them all from social media and proof that he no longer has contact with any of them. I feel horrible for making him do that and I feel like I took it too far, but after all that, I have 0 self-confidence now and I always find myself comparing myself to them, especially the girl he wouldn&#39;t shut up about.</p>\n\n<p>Am I wrong for doing this? What should I do? He said he&#39;d do anything to make me happy and get my confidence back, but I feel like he broke a big boundary.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR my bf made me feel bad about myself because he wouldn&#39;t stop talking about how great a girl he slept with was before we started dating. It ended up making me feel self conscious and it caused two bad fights but I feel like an a**hole</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you for your comments everyone. As much as it hurts, I know what I need to do. I won’t be interacting on this post anymore, but I’ll still read the comments. I hope you all have a great day.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"c8ef68fc-cb00-11e2-8393-12313d262949","can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fcmyih","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Advice-needed1234567","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":34,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fcmyih/my_22f_bf_23m_broke_a_boundary_twice_and_its/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fcmyih/my_22f_bf_23m_broke_a_boundary_twice_and_its/","subreddit_subscribers":2795086,"created_utc":1583199328,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},"fegkgv":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"Hi  to anyone reading this, I've posted on this subreddit before and  received some really lovely advice, so I figured I would try again.\n\nI  \\[28F\\] was with my ex \\[32M\\] for 6 years.

So we sell the house, and I move 8 hours away with baby and two dogs with his parents in a town two hours from where we were supposed to move. He needed to stay in MN to finish up work, and spent one week there, one week with us. This went on for three months until he decided to quit.

However, the job was in a small town... 400 people. I agreed because it seemed like a great opportunity. So we move into a house, and the job falls through.

That I need to be a priority, and I have needs that are not being met. I have taken on 100% of the household duties even though I have a full time job as well, trying to make time for us. \n\nThe other day I took him on a dinner date, then out for a glass of wine and it somehow turned into an argument because an acquaintance from work asked me to go to a concert with her and I said Yes. Since I'm trying to actually make friends here. But since I didn't ask my bf if he wanted to go, he got mad and we went home upset with each other. Which ended the night without sex. Even tho it was clear from before we even got in the car together that was the end goal for the evening. I was very clear about this. \n\nI  do all of the cooking, cleaning, shopping etc. Just so there would be more time for us. Lastnight We had dinner done, and cleaned up before 6PM, I'm thinking so we can spend the rest of the evening together. He makes a joke about \"hanky panky\" before bed. But nope. We watched tv for a little while, then I went to bed at 830, by my self. He didn't even come into bed with me cause he was still watching tv. \nI wake up this morning. Alone. He's already up. \nWe have teenage children from previous relationships. One lives with us, which is in part why there is a lack of intimacy. And then he is often busy with his kids after school/work. Going to the gym, doing homework, etc. Which is why he never has time for me. \n\nI don't know what to do. There Is little time, less energy and no matter what I say or do, I'm not a priority, my needs are not being met. I have expressed this. He says he cares and will try harder.

Things were going OK for the 3 months we dated but just  before Christmas, She tells me that her roommate is leaving and wouldn't  be able to afford the apartment and was going to be homeless. I panic a  bit and offered to move in to help with the rent. She immediately said  yes. She managed to get another roommate to move in, in the other room (*It's a 2 room - 1 Bath apartment*).  So I move in and beginning of January, Miley gave me the news that she  has Abdominal Cancer. She even told our new roommate. I was really  scared on what to do and just thought I best give her the best time of  her life and help her as much as I can. But something was off. When I  started to ask Miley if I could drive her to her doctors to do a check  up on the cancer, she said she didn't want me to come along because she  feared I might react badly again just like when she first told me about  her finding out about her cancer. OK, thought maybe she needed some time  to adjust and for me to get us to the news. Later on I started to get  suspicions that something wasn't right. I could have sworn that she told  me it was stage 3. I asked Sandy but I don't remember how it went,  whether she knew in the first place what stage it was. I asked her if  she believed Miley had cancer and she found it odd that Miley was acting  very calm about her cancer. Also the fact that Miley wouldn't tell her  parents that she has cancer. So me and Sandy decided that we're not  going to say anything until we can catch Miley in a lie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few things that raised my suspicions about Miley's cancer was the fact she is using a vape pen with CBD in it (*I am not getting into the politics on whether or not CBD/Weed cures anything. I'm not here for that*).  Has not changed her diet to help adjust to the cancer. Does not mention  any of the symptoms that relate to the cancer other than that she had a  couple of black stools. Last, she seems very calm and even happy on a  daily bases. When my Grandma had breast cancer, she thought it for 15  years and it was pretty obvious how she was struggling to survive. I  would come in and help with vacuuming and cleaning the house. She needed  to eat specific foods so to not trigger any pains or cause her cancer  to grow even more and she would go to the doctors every week for a check  up. There was always development as to what was going on. Eve3ryone in  the family was involved. Unfortunately she passed away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm  not a doctor,specialist, nor have so much knowledge on cancer. But when  putting these scenarios together, things just don't add up. One day,  Miley had mentioned to me that her Mom thought it was cute of me to do a  special diner for her and her parents. She was still talking to her  parents. When we came back home, I was curious as to what her Mom said  about me and she said don't worry. Now me and Miley shared our phone  passwords in case of an emergency. I went in and looked into her phone  and wanted to see what her Mom said. I got curious and went back in the  texts before we dated. There I found a moment where she told her Mom she  had stage 1 abdominal cancer. Miley's mom didn't react well either but  she caught on soon and found out she was lying. She even mentioned that  Miley was pretending to have cancer just to manipulate her and to see  her reaction. I sent a screen shot copy to my self real quick and  deleted the text later showing I sent them to myself. I show the texts  to Sandy and she was disappointed. So we both agree to not say anything  because her are the problems that Im currently now in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI  had a work related accident where my foot got hurt and have a hard time  getting around. I have to walk around in a special boot and a cane just  to get around. Another problem was that I had just moved in with her  and we signed a 1 year lease on the apartment. That lease ends next year  in February. I also gave away my newer queen matters which we both  sleep on, since her old on was 12 years old and had a lot of stains on  it. The apartment is conveniently close to my work but now I don't want  to move away. Also I'm on light duty at work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow  Im trying to be careful about this on how Im going to present this lie  that Miley has created. But I'm afraid that she will suggest we cancel  the lease or threaten something possibly worse. I don't know what it  could be but I noticed how she gets very upset if I accuse her of  anything. I already been homeless and down-under before. I don't want it  happen again. Please help.\n\nIf you need any context or clarification, please don't be afraid to ask.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSIDE NOTES **\\*Update**\n\n1. She's  trans-gender and we were having a hard time coming up with a way to  meet my parents. My Dad drove me home on the day I had my work accident  and needed to use the bathroom. Miley was just coming out of the  bathroom and my Dad saw her. She freaked out. My Dad left and he was  cool and seemed chill about it. Said he was sorry. I'm afraid though he  maybe sad about what he actually saw though I can't tell. Aside from  that, after Dad left, Miley went mad and threw things around the house  and got mad at me for deliberately having my Dad come over. That was not  my intention to do so nor did I know she was in the bathroom. So she  threaten to kill her self. I freaked out and begged her to stop. She  punched me and went to try and overdoes on some pills. I didn't know  what it was but I managed to calm her down. That's when my suspicions  grew even more.\n2. So  recently, Miley did have to go to the hospital and I drove her. She was  having chest pains. This I believed because she would thrash out in her  sleep to pain in her chest. So when we finally get to the doctors, they  found nothing on her blood text except that her white blood cell count  is slightly above normal. I can't remember if the doctor said there were  no signs of cancer but I though I heard him say it. It didn't register  to me after we left the hospital. The doctor thinks she has an early  stage of  pneumonia and she should just take antibiotics for the time  being.\n3. During  our time waiting for the doctor, I had asked her if she was diagnosed  with any cancer or disease or anything before we had started dating. The  way she said \"no\" was kind of off setting. That basically confirmed it  to me that she might be not lying, but also using me.\n4. **NEW\\*** I have no place to go and crash. My family is on the other side of the country and I really can't go back. It's just my Dad here and he can't have me crash at his place because he literally has no space for me.","author_fullname":"t2_5twilxo3","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"I need help","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationships","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"new","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_fcibix","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":21,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"[new]","can_mod_post":false,"score":21,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":1583183019,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1583209464,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.relationships","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>TL;DR I think my girlfriend is lying about her cancer and I don&#39;t know how to go about it</p>\n\n<p>We will call my girlfriend Miley</p>\n\n<p>My roommate Sandy</p>\n\n<p>I  dated and moved in with my girlfriend Miley only 5 months into our  relationship.

I asked her if  she believed Miley had cancer and she found it odd that Miley was acting  very calm about her cancer. Also the fact that Miley wouldn&#39;t tell her  parents that she has cancer. So me and Sandy decided that we&#39;re not  going to say anything until we can catch Miley in a lie.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>A few things that raised my suspicions about Miley&#39;s cancer was the fact she is using a vape pen with CBD in it (<em>I am not getting into the politics on whether or not CBD/Weed cures anything. I&#39;m not here for that</em>).  Has not changed her diet to help adjust to the cancer. Does not mention  any of the symptoms that relate to the cancer other than that she had a  couple of black stools. Last, she seems very calm and even happy on a  daily bases. When my Grandma had breast cancer, she thought it for 15  years and it was pretty obvious how she was struggling to survive. I  would come in and help with vacuuming and cleaning the house. She needed  to eat specific foods so to not trigger any pains or cause her cancer  to grow even more and she would go to the doctors every week for a check  up. There was always development as to what was going on. Eve3ryone in  the family was involved. Unfortunately she passed away.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m  not a doctor,specialist, nor have so much knowledge on cancer. But when  putting these scenarios together, things just don&#39;t add up. One day,  Miley had mentioned to me that her Mom thought it was cute of me to do a  special diner for her and her parents. She was still talking to her  parents. When we came back home, I was curious as to what her Mom said  about me and she said don&#39;t worry. Now me and Miley shared our phone  passwords in case of an emergency. I went in and looked into her phone  and wanted to see what her Mom said. I got curious and went back in the  texts before we dated. There I found a moment where she told her Mom she  had stage 1 abdominal cancer. Miley&#39;s mom didn&#39;t react well either but  she caught on soon and found out she was lying. She even mentioned that  Miley was pretending to have cancer just to manipulate her and to see  her reaction. I sent a screen shot copy to my self real quick and  deleted the text later showing I sent them to myself. I show the texts  to Sandy and she was disappointed. So we both agree to not say anything  because her are the problems that Im currently now in.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I  had a work related accident where my foot got hurt and have a hard time  getting around. I have to walk around in a special boot and a cane just  to get around. Another problem was that I had just moved in with her  and we signed a 1 year lease on the apartment. That lease ends next year  in February. I also gave away my newer queen matters which we both  sleep on, since her old on was 12 years old and had a lot of stains on  it. The apartment is conveniently close to my work but now I don&#39;t want  to move away. Also I&#39;m on light duty at work.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now  Im trying to be careful about this on how Im going to present this lie  that Miley has created. But I&#39;m afraid that she will suggest we cancel  the lease or threaten something possibly worse. I don&#39;t know what it  could be but I noticed how she gets very upset if I accuse her of  anything. I already been homeless and down-under before. I don&#39;t want it  happen again. Please help.</p>\n\n<p>If you need any context or clarification, please don&#39;t be afraid to ask.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>SIDE NOTES <strong>*Update</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>She&#39;s  trans-gender and we were having a hard time coming up with a way to  meet my parents. My Dad drove me home on the day I had my work accident  and needed to use the bathroom. Miley was just coming out of the  bathroom and my Dad saw her. She freaked out. My Dad left and he was  cool and seemed chill about it. Said he was sorry. I&#39;m afraid though he  maybe sad about what he actually saw though I can&#39;t tell. Aside from  that, after Dad left, Miley went mad and threw things around the house  and got mad at me for deliberately having my Dad come over. That was not  my intention to do so nor did I know she was in the bathroom. So she  threaten to kill her self. I freaked out and begged her to stop. She  punched me and went to try and overdoes on some pills. I didn&#39;t know  what it was but I managed to calm her down. That&#39;s when my suspicions  grew even more.</li>\n<li>So  recently, Miley did have to go to the hospital and I drove her. She was  having chest pains. This I believed because she would thrash out in her  sleep to pain in her chest. So when we finally get to the doctors, they  found nothing on her blood text except that her white blood cell count  is slightly above normal. I can&#39;t remember if the doctor said there were  no signs of cancer but I though I heard him say it. It didn&#39;t register  to me after we left the hospital. The doctor thinks she has an early  stage of  pneumonia and she should just take antibiotics for the time  being.</li>\n<li>During  our time waiting for the doctor, I had asked her if she was diagnosed  with any cancer or disease or anything before we had started dating. The  way she said &quot;no&quot; was kind of off setting. That basically confirmed it  to me that she might be not lying, but also using me.</li>\n<li><strong>NEW\\</strong>* I have no place to go and crash. My family is on the other side of the country and I really can&#39;t go back. It&#39;s just my Dad here and he can&#39;t have me crash at his place because he literally has no space for me.</li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fcibix","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Throwaway2393734","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":13,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fcibix/i_need_help/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fcibix/i_need_help/","subreddit_subscribers":2795086,"created_utc":1583180664,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},"fe6lbi":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/euzpcf/mom_49f_and_i_16_almost_17n_disagree_about_top/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI have good news!!!

Which is probably true. I'm not that good a talker. I never said \"everything will be alright\" because it felt wrong to say that. But she wanted to hear it, among many other things. I can promise to her I'll seek help for this.\n* My wife has had anger issues which developed worse and worse. In her fits, she yells for divorce or says I'm not a real guy, that I cannot make any emotional connections. Every week I hear these things.  And she never apologizes for this when she calms down.\n* Despite that I'm not a great talker, I don't think I did anything to deserve this. When she gets angry I am even a worse talker. And that makes her even more angry, for which she blames me. I'm left without words. She thinks she can get me to talk by being angry, but the opposite is true. \n* I refuse to have kids with her before these troubles are solved, but she insists having kids would make her happy, and it would help solve her anger problems. She's angry I refuse to have kids now.\n* Two weeks ago I moved out of the house because I couldn't stand it any longer, I needed my own space to feel comfortable. My work was suffering and every day I felt like I was walking on egg shells. Every sound would trigger her. I still see her sometimes though, we are on speaking terms.\n\nI'm not sure if this marriage is over, I would like to give it one more chance. \n\n* I can promise to her that I will seek help to be a better talker\n* But I want to tell her I want zero mentions of divorce, zero insults on me as a person.\n* And I want her to apologize for all the incredibly mean things she has said to me. \n* I also want her to get a job or some hobby. She's hooked on her phone most of the day, and aside selling some second hand stuff she's in the house all the time. It's not healthy because the only person she meets is me.\n\nI almost want to draw up a contract for her: rules of play. It doesn't need to be a perfect marriage, but it needs to be good enough.

Most of them don't last very long and always end for similar reasons, I end up losing interest in the girl I'm with because I find them to be too immature, dependent, clingy, or lack self awareness. \nI grew up as fairly independent, I moved out at 17 and lived away from my parents since. I don't really get along with my parents or much of my family, don't hate them or anything, just prefer to be away from them. They didn't do anything abhorrent, we just weren't affectionate, and i haven't really got much reason to talk to them. \nMy current girlfriend has a bit of a dysfunctional family herself, she doesn't get along with her mother, has a difficult autistic younger brother, but regards her father pretty highly, she's pretty mentally stable and handles herself reasonably well. She's young though, I usually date older women. She was a virgin before I met her, she's always sort of been a good girl and did everything by the books, very intelligent too, much smarter than I am with theoretical knowledge.\nInitially, I was crazy about my girlfriend. When I first started seeing her I was really drawn to her independence, bubbly personality, the strong hold she had on her emotions, and I'll admit, maybe partly the thrill of the chase of the flirt and the \"will we won't we\"\nWe've been officially together 10 months now. \nAs the relationship progressed, she revealed the scholarships she'd received, the financial support from her parents, she lives with her grandma who is close to her University, and doesn't pay rent. This didn't bother me much, but I made note of it. I guess it just feels a bit less equal to me when she gets a lot more support, as I've mostly had to do everything by myself since before I even finished high school, but I can hardly hold independent financial stability as a prerequisite for my relationships. \nSecondly, I started to notice she just wasn't really that decisive, I kind of make all the decisions of where we go and what we do, occasionally she'll try to surprise me a bit, but very rarely. \nThirdly, she started becoming more emotionally vulnerable, which I suppose is pretty normal and good that she feels she can confide in me, but when she sits down crying into my arms about her family troubles and financial stresses I can't help feeling a little less attracted to her, as her ability to remain stoic was what made me attracted to her from the beginning, and though I'm pretty open about how I'm feeling, I don't really get very emotional when I discuss personal things. \n\nI've sort of phrased this so far as reasons *she* has made me lose interest, but this happens with pretty much every relationship I'm in, though none of them have lasted this long. I always pick holes in my relationships and decide why they can't work, only thing is the holes are fairly that consistent \"she's too soft, she's too indecisive, she's too dependent, and she's too clingy\"\nI'm not sure if I just keep repeating the same mistake of going for a certain incompatible type of girl, or if I just keep sabotaging my relationships by behaving in a certain way that makes the women I'm with become more watered down versions of themselves. I've got flaws in my relationship style that I'm trying to work on, I'm quite stubborn, even controlling at times.

Most of them don&#39;t last very long and always end for similar reasons, I end up losing interest in the girl I&#39;m with because I find them to be too immature, dependent, clingy, or lack self awareness. \nI grew up as fairly independent, I moved out at 17 and lived away from my parents since. I don&#39;t really get along with my parents or much of my family, don&#39;t hate them or anything, just prefer to be away from them. They didn&#39;t do anything abhorrent, we just weren&#39;t affectionate, and i haven&#39;t really got much reason to talk to them. \nMy current girlfriend has a bit of a dysfunctional family herself, she doesn&#39;t get along with her mother, has a difficult autistic younger brother, but regards her father pretty highly, she&#39;s pretty mentally stable and handles herself reasonably well. She&#39;s young though, I usually date older women. She was a virgin before I met her, she&#39;s always sort of been a good girl and did everything by the books, very intelligent too, much smarter than I am with theoretical knowledge.\nInitially, I was crazy about my girlfriend. When I first started seeing her I was really drawn to her independence, bubbly personality, the strong hold she had on her emotions, and I&#39;ll admit, maybe partly the thrill of the chase of the flirt and the &quot;will we won&#39;t we&quot;\nWe&#39;ve been officially together 10 months now. \nAs the relationship progressed, she revealed the scholarships she&#39;d received, the financial support from her parents, she lives with her grandma who is close to her University, and doesn&#39;t pay rent. This didn&#39;t bother me much, but I made note of it. I guess it just feels a bit less equal to me when she gets a lot more support, as I&#39;ve mostly had to do everything by myself since before I even finished high school, but I can hardly hold independent financial stability as a prerequisite for my relationships. \nSecondly, I started to notice she just wasn&#39;t really that decisive, I kind of make all the decisions of where we go and what we do, occasionally she&#39;ll try to surprise me a bit, but very rarely. \nThirdly, she started becoming more emotionally vulnerable, which I suppose is pretty normal and good that she feels she can confide in me, but when she sits down crying into my arms about her family troubles and financial stresses I can&#39;t help feeling a little less attracted to her, as her ability to remain stoic was what made me attracted to her from the beginning, and though I&#39;m pretty open about how I&#39;m feeling, I don&#39;t really get very emotional when I discuss personal things. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve sort of phrased this so far as reasons <em>she</em> has made me lose interest, but this happens with pretty much every relationship I&#39;m in, though none of them have lasted this long. I always pick holes in my relationships and decide why they can&#39;t work, only thing is the holes are fairly that consistent &quot;she&#39;s too soft, she&#39;s too indecisive, she&#39;s too dependent, and she&#39;s too clingy&quot;\nI&#39;m not sure if I just keep repeating the same mistake of going for a certain incompatible type of girl, or if I just keep sabotaging my relationships by behaving in a certain way that makes the women I&#39;m with become more watered down versions of themselves. I&#39;ve got flaws in my relationship style that I&#39;m trying to work on, I&#39;m quite stubborn, even controlling at times. I can get jealous, I don&#39;t like being constantly affectionate, and I very much like my personal space.

I told my GF to come with us and I even told her I would invite her, but she told me that she didn't feel comfortable when people invite her and never confirmed whether she'd come with us or not. Until my friends showed up and we were able to locate everybody, it became 19:40. We also hadn't previously decided on a place to go and have dinner/beers. There were several places in our area and we walked around trying to find an attractive place to get settled. At around 20:30, she called me and asked me where I was and reminded me that we agreed to meet. I apologised to her for not writing to her but I told her that I didn't because we were walking around and that I cannot message her while walking, and that I would send her our location as soon as we found a place. She replied with, \"No! I scheduled to meet with YOU, and only YOU. So you are not coming?\" I repeated the part about sending her my location as soon as we had one. She said, \"No. I am not meeting your stupid friends and in my opinion, go to hell!\" \n\nMy friends and I took a group photo and I sent it to her. I guess that was to make her jealous that she cannot hold me back from meeting my friends, as she had done in the past. She blocked me on WhatsApp. GF has since unblocked me but I haven't spoken to her since. It's been a week with no contact. This morning, her sister wrote to me, \"What happened? You're not coming by anymore\". The first thing I thought when I read that was why do I have to go to her? Can she not come to my place? She rarely comes to my place because she is no longer eligible for a young transport pass in our city. However, I am. GF also doesn't work and prefers not to pay 3€ for the ride to my place. I also thought about all of our previous fights/arguments. All of them have the same structure: \n\nGF tells me to meet -> I say I don't know but maybe -> GF misunderstands it as a yes -> GF asks, quite rudely, \"so are you coming?\" -> I give her a LEGITIMATE reason not to come (related either to my studies or housework, sometimes a mandatory flight from flight school) -> GF blaming me for \"not organising my time well\" and for \"being an irresponsible egoist\" -> me trying to change the plan to accommodate both my obligations as well as her wishes -> GF not having it -> **me** having to **apologise** to **her** thousands of times just to acknowledge me again. \n\nI am not interested in being in a relationship with a girl who is practically as religious as a nun (as mentioned in my previous post) who will manipulate me like this. All these fights and her actions to make me feel bad are part of a greater psychological and emotional manipulation. \n\nMy friends tell me that I shouldn't talk to her, and that if **she** wants to talk to **me**, she should do it first. My parents and brother tell me that it's been a week with no contact and I should initiate the conversation with her and consider whether this relationship is good for me or not. Some Reddit users commented on how we may no longer be compatible and that we should break up. **I am completely torn apart and have no idea what to do next, and how to make things clear between us.** I would also like to add that I do have feelings for her and that I consider them, but it's hard for me to predict how exactly my actions might affect her.

First of all I want to make it clear that I really love my BF and he loves me, we’ve been together for 7 years (5 years living together), and our relationship is stable, we can trust each other, never one of us did something hurtful or damaging to our relationship or anything like that. \n\n\nThe thing is; he is the only man I’ve ever been with, he was my first real boyfriend, and lately (like since the last year) I’ve been having fantasies very often about being with other men, I have found myself like staring at guys that I feel attracted to thinking about doing sex stuff to them. I don’t mean I stare like a creep, but I’m like really seeing the guys in my surroundings, I used not to pay attention to men walking next to me or near me in general but I am now.\n\n\nIn my single years I never had the opportunity to go out with friends maybe to a bar and flirt with random guys, I grew up in a very conservative family so I was only able to live freely like a normal adult woman when I started living with my boyfriend. From time to time I feel I bit sad I couldn’t go through those experiences.\n\n\nAnyways, sometimes when I catch guys looking at me (I know I’m good looking) if I find them hot I respond with a slight smile and a flirtatious look, if we start talking ABOUT RANDOM STUFF and I’m feeling a bit hot I subtly play with my hair, give them a smile and stare at their eyes and lips attentively while they’re talking to me, then, I find a reason to casually focus my attention to something else and that’s it, I leave with a polite goodbye. I think of it like an innocent game because of course I don’t plan to act on it, my relationship is monogamous, I don’t hide the fact that I have a boyfriend to anyone.\n\n\nBut guys, lately it’s like I can’t stop finding guys attractive somewhere I go, coworkers, people at the same park I take my dog for walks. I like playing this innocent game as I said above, so for example I’ve flirted with my gym trainer (NOT a personal trainer), he started it though, he without a reason played with my hair (ponytail) for a sec and almost always greeted me when I arrived to the gym (it wasn’t necessary as I already had my routine planned and didn’t need help) somehow he always said hi, he was the only trainer to call me for a short name (diminutive name), sometimes he walked near where I was in some machine doing an exercise and he touched my ankle and smiled. I’ve casually mentioned in chats with him that I have a boyfriend, I didn’t want to give him the wrong idea. This guy is so freaking hot, veeeery hot, I couldn’t not let myself admire his face and body. The most “risky flirt” with this guy was staring at his eyes while he spoke to me and slowly look at his lips and back at his eyes, I think he got some of this vibe by the look on his face but as I said it was just that, besides it lasted a few minutes. I remember I felt so turned on at that moment by the sexual tension that I even got a little wet, I wanted to fuck him but nothing happened and it’s okay. I’ve been very busy with work lately so I paused the gym and I haven’t seen him in a while...I kinda miss him.\n\n\nWhat I’m trying to say is that I feel like everything turns me on now, I’m choosing erotic literature and comics, have been watching considerably more porn than before, fantasizing with men I know and trying to look for similar people in porn. I think I’ve always been very vanilla but now I fantasize about devil’s threesomes, about men I now, about characters, actors... with being maybe slapped and having my hair pulled, having a man’s hand pressing my neck (I don’t know if I would like erotic asphyxiation but I fantasize about it). Guys, I have got wet multiple times just for watching a hot guy in a cafeteria -or public place- and thinking about this stuff.\n\n\nAnd the weird thing is: I don’t feel this extreme arousal when I get turned on by my boyfriend, or when I think about having sex with him. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy sex with him, he isn’t great at kissing which I fantasize about a lot too but he’s great in bed and can even pleasure me with multiple orgasms...he has stated that he couldn’t believe I was a virgin when we started dating because everything I did was incredibly good like an experienced person would be, but I wonder how it would be with somebody else? I don’t know, I think my BF and I can try some things but what I feel like I need is another man. \n\n\n\nWhat do you guys think about this and what advice would you give me?. Hope you have a nice day, thanks for reading.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I have been in a monogamous relationship for 7 years, have a good sexual life with my BF, but now I can’t stop thinking about other men to the point off getting wet just for looking at hot men in public places and fantasizing about them. Advice please. :) \n\nPS: As you have guessed, English isn’t my mother tongue so I’m sorry if I made some mistakes.","author_fullname":"t2_29lyuxw9","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"[27F] in a long term relationship of 7yrs, feeling extra curious coughhornycough for other men","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationships","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"m-io personal","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_fd98x2","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":0,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Personal issues","can_mod_post":false,"score":0,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"nsfw","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1583333905,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":3,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.relationships","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys, I really hope you can give me some advice here.

(It's a fellowship where you must pay - 1 year liberal arts course).  She had the expectation of a placement (In India the University the  expected to help you get a job). It's the first time she has every paid  any significant amount for education. And she really wants a good ROI.\n\nIt's March, and she hasn't gotten a job or even gotten through any placement round.  \nShe's dejected and is in many ways unleashing her fury upon me.\n\nIf  I call her after she tells me she was rejected, but don't call enough  times - she'll be disappointed and furious and says no-one cares about  her. If I tell her, I can't talk more at night because I'm sleepy and I  have work the next day - she gets furious at my priorities. She'll say I  don't support her, or give her time - but I literally stop working so  that I can text her for hours on end only to have her chewing off my  head. I have a few projects going on, and I'm giving as much time as  possible to her - I understand she's going through a lot, the job  application process is horrible, and companies here are unprofessional  and altogether pathetic in so many ways (Indian society is terrible for  so many reasons and for so many causes (fuck Central Turks and British).  I'm trying to be supportive. At first I tried pragmatic advice - do X,  do Y. She agrees but never follows through unless I spoon feed it to  her. It's basic advice - learn how to code, practice your eloquence,  practice your writing - basically become more skilled. But I feel like  it was making her more insecure, so now I just listen and say its  difficult. I'm there, and other platitudes and aphorisms. But she's  saying, I'm not helping, and continues to chew me out for the most minor  things. For example, I stopped texting her for a few minutes to make  instant noodles - I got chewed out for telling her I wasn't busy when I  was busy making noodles.\n\nThe  biggest issue is her expectations. She won't voice what she wants me to  do, but when I don't do what she wants she'll get very angry. Then when  she finally voices it, and I do it - she'll reject it because I only did  it because she voiced it. I should have done it on my own. I try to  explain I'm not a mind-reader, but she says I lack emotional  intelligence, and I'm individualistic/selfish (which she chalks to being  American). For example, she would take a metro ride to get to my side  of town, and we would book a hotel together (I stay with my parents for a  plethora of reasons). But then she got mad at me for not picking her up  deep in town, I then offered to pick her up, but she said I should have  figured it out for myself and then refused my ride. She then continued  to lament my inability to think about her from her perspective. I  thought she was comfortable with the situation and would voice her  concerns if they arose, but apparently you only voice concerns when its  too late.\n\nI've made mistakes too.  On one of my birthdays, I somewhat rejected a gift she made for me. It  was a glow in the dark jar, but it didn't work, was gross, slimey and  repugnant. I said I was grateful for the effort and told her such, but  she's furious I didn't keep it. In retaliation she rejected my gift a  remote controlled car that I specially 3d printed and assembled for her.  Additionally, I've had a vivid history with multiple relationships, and  for some stupid reason in the beginning of the two years - I told her  all of it. I also stupidly made comparisons when she requested it, and  the comparisons were altogether too honest. I told her she was better  than past relationships in X way, and worse in Y way. She has only  focused on the Y ways. All these things happened at the beginning of the  relationship, but she won't forget and won't forgive. It's like every  fight is about these two things, and how dare I say them.\n\nMore about her:  \nShe  lacks nuance. I think she splits pretty heavily, everything is black  and white to her. I can't even bring up hypothetical because she can't  process them. She can't take criticism - no matter how constructive.  I've tried to help her - but I literally can't because any comment will  be construed as a personal attack. She comes from a matrilineal line  (It's fascinating), and once had very high self-esteem and confidence  (it was sexy). But the repeated rejections have crushed her confidence -  I think her splitting which at one point made her dominant, now makes  her hate herself for being a failure.\n\nShe  is also very free in terms of time. The course she is taking is rather  pathetic (in my mind). I mean it has a good name in the country, but the  liberals arts I took (top in US) was leagues above this. I was working  my ass off, but she has two courses for two weeks which assign barely  any coursework/reading/projects. The one course I thought had merit  (statistical analysis {I'm a data geek}) she pushed onto me - and I  walked her through/even did all of her coursework.\n\nIntellectually,  we are on two different planes. I don't mind - because she will listen  to me rant about whatever topic and I'm fairly didactic. From the stock  market to the finer points of Kannada philosophy - I have given her  foundational knowledge about various facets of life she just did not  understand earlier (Although she has expressed to me she dislikes  philosophy as being too theoretical (a valid concern as Aurangzeb  described so vividly in a letter to his teacher)). I'm not certain if  she still does because she isn't all that responsive in conversation,  but I think it's just the frustration of a lack of job is eating her up  inside. Conversations are mostly dominated by me, but not for lack of  trying. It's just, since I read/work/do so much, I just have many/many  things to discuss. It's also little observations I note - little things  of society/culture you abstract with observations and reflection - it's  all very intellectual. If she does converse it's usually about people - I  don't mind gossip - in fact I love gossip about people I don't know  (usually so I can abstract it into lessons about people). But she  realizes I crave more intellectual discussion, and I believe feels  inadequate that she cannot deliver.\n\nWe  just had a fight yesterday. She acknowledges the discomfort she is  causing me, and says she cannot fathom why I am sticking around. She  tells me that if she was in my socks she would have left. I tell her,  that pain and joy are intertwined - the sadness of today is the joy I  will feel tomorrow - and I am certain that once she gets a job her  neurosis will level off and return to pre-rejection levels.\n\nShe  now wants a break of one week. Am I crazy for trying to weather this  storm? Are we too fundamentally different. Is this relationship a bad  investment that at the first sign of a economic downturn it starts  crumbling and exposing itself for the Non-Performing Asset it is?\n\nTL;DR! Girlfriend is unleashing her frustration at me due to failure to find job. Is this a temporary thing or does it expose deeper issues?","author_fullname":"t2_18ab4mve","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"25M with 25F of 2 years - Compatibility Issues","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/relationships","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"new","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_fbpgtv","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":0,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"[new]","can_mod_post":false,"score":0,"approved_by":null,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1583068815,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.relationships","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So, I&#39;m dating this 24F, I&#39;m 25M in India.<br/>\nI&#39;m  American Indian (third-culture kid/migratory bird{switched between  India and US every few years of my life}), but ended up working in the  country for a variety of reasons.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve been dating this girl for two years, and its been pretty good.</p>\n\n<p>A  year ago, she left for a fellowship at a a university a few hours away.

I&#39;m trying to be supportive. At first I tried pragmatic advice - do X,  do Y. She agrees but never follows through unless I spoon feed it to  her. It&#39;s basic advice - learn how to code, practice your eloquence,  practice your writing - basically become more skilled. But I feel like  it was making her more insecure, so now I just listen and say its  difficult. I&#39;m there, and other platitudes and aphorisms. But she&#39;s  saying, I&#39;m not helping, and continues to chew me out for the most minor  things. For example, I stopped texting her for a few minutes to make  instant noodles - I got chewed out for telling her I wasn&#39;t busy when I  was busy making noodles.</p>\n\n<p>The  biggest issue is her expectations. She won&#39;t voice what she wants me to  do, but when I don&#39;t do what she wants she&#39;ll get very angry. Then when  she finally voices it, and I do it - she&#39;ll reject it because I only did  it because she voiced it. I should have done it on my own. I try to  explain I&#39;m not a mind-reader, but she says I lack emotional  intelligence, and I&#39;m individualistic/selfish (which she chalks to being  American). For example, she would take a metro ride to get to my side  of town, and we would book a hotel together (I stay with my parents for a  plethora of reasons). But then she got mad at me for not picking her up  deep in town, I then offered to pick her up, but she said I should have  figured it out for myself and then refused my ride. She then continued  to lament my inability to think about her from her perspective. I  thought she was comfortable with the situation and would voice her  concerns if they arose, but apparently you only voice concerns when its  too late.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve made mistakes too.  On one of my birthdays, I somewhat rejected a gift she made for me. It  was a glow in the dark jar, but it didn&#39;t work, was gross, slimey and  repugnant. I said I was grateful for the effort and told her such, but  she&#39;s furious I didn&#39;t keep it. In retaliation she rejected my gift a  remote controlled car that I specially 3d printed and assembled for her.  Additionally, I&#39;ve had a vivid history with multiple relationships, and  for some stupid reason in the beginning of the two years - I told her  all of it. I also stupidly made comparisons when she requested it, and  the comparisons were altogether too honest. I told her she was better  than past relationships in X way, and worse in Y way. She has only  focused on the Y ways. All these things happened at the beginning of the  relationship, but she won&#39;t forget and won&#39;t forgive. It&#39;s like every  fight is about these two things, and how dare I say them.</p>\n\n<p>More about her:<br/>\nShe  lacks nuance. I think she splits pretty heavily, everything is black  and white to her. I can&#39;t even bring up hypothetical because she can&#39;t  process them. She can&#39;t take criticism - no matter how constructive.  I&#39;ve tried to help her - but I literally can&#39;t because any comment will  be construed as a personal attack. She comes from a matrilineal line  (It&#39;s fascinating), and once had very high self-esteem and confidence  (it was sexy). But the repeated rejections have crushed her confidence -  I think her splitting which at one point made her dominant, now makes  her hate herself for being a failure.</p>\n\n<p>She  is also very free in terms of time. The course she is taking is rather  pathetic (in my mind). I mean it has a good name in the country, but the  liberals arts I took (top in US) was leagues above this. I was working  my ass off, but she has two courses for two weeks which assign barely  any coursework/reading/projects. The one course I thought had merit  (statistical analysis {I&#39;m a data geek}) she pushed onto me - and I  walked her through/even did all of her coursework.</p>\n\n<p>Intellectually,  we are on two different planes. I don&#39;t mind - because she will listen  to me rant about whatever topic and I&#39;m fairly didactic. From the stock  market to the finer points of Kannada philosophy - I have given her  foundational knowledge about various facets of life she just did not  understand earlier (Although she has expressed to me she dislikes  philosophy as being too theoretical (a valid concern as Aurangzeb  described so vividly in a letter to his teacher)). I&#39;m not certain if  she still does because she isn&#39;t all that responsive in conversation,  but I think it&#39;s just the frustration of a lack of job is eating her up  inside. Conversations are mostly dominated by me, but not for lack of  trying. It&#39;s just, since I read/work/do so much, I just have many/many  things to discuss. It&#39;s also little observations I note - little things  of society/culture you abstract with observations and reflection - it&#39;s  all very intellectual. If she does converse it&#39;s usually about people - I  don&#39;t mind gossip - in fact I love gossip about people I don&#39;t know  (usually so I can abstract it into lessons about people). But she  realizes I crave more intellectual discussion, and I believe feels  inadequate that she cannot deliver.</p>\n\n<p>We  just had a fight yesterday. She acknowledges the discomfort she is  causing me, and says she cannot fathom why I am sticking around. She  tells me that if she was in my socks she would have left. I tell her,  that pain and joy are intertwined - the sadness of today is the joy I  will feel tomorrow - and I am certain that once she gets a job her  neurosis will level off and return to pre-rejection levels.</p>\n\n<p>She  now wants a break of one week. Am I crazy for trying to weather this  storm? Are we too fundamentally different. Is this relationship a bad  investment that at the first sign of a economic downturn it starts  crumbling and exposing itself for the Non-Performing Asset it is?</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR! Girlfriend is unleashing her frustration at me due to failure to find job. Is this a temporary thing or does it expose deeper issues?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"confidence","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qjvn","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"fbpgtv","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"dhruvg001","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":4,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/relationships/comments/fbpgtv/25m_with_25f_of_2_years_compatibility_issues/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fbpgtv/25m_with_25f_of_2_years_compatibility_issues/","subreddit_subscribers":2795086,"created_utc":1583040015,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"comments":[]},"feb2by":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"relationships","selftext":"Background, I have a DD (F5) from previous relationship and have full custody of her.\n\nI have been in relationship with my GF (F39) for about 3 years.

We have met 4 times so far. 3 of those times (including the day we first met) were spent at his place — averaging 8 hours each day full of sex, Netflix, tons of cuddling, laughing/joking, eating food, etc. On the second date, he brought up he was open to more (but that we were both casual for now). On the third date, we both mentioned we weren’t seeing other people. \n\nThe fourth time, last night, he invited me to watch his hockey game, joined by two of his brothers (30/m and 25/m). \n\nI knew his brothers were coming, and I was really unsure how he’d be acting in front of them. To spare myself of possible hurt, I told myself ahead of time that he would treat me as a buddy (“friends” with benefits) in front of them. \n\nI got there ahead of time and noticed a guy who resembled him was looking at me in a certain, intentional way with a slight smile. (I found out later that was his younger brother, & he had told him “someone” would be coming to the hockey game). \n\nLater, the guy showed up with his older brother. He walked up to me and gave me a kiss. After the game, his brothers, he and I were all just hanging out at the hockey rink. Throughout the entire time, he was showing me tons of physical affection both in a sweet and naughty way in front of his brothers and also other hockey teammates passing by — kisses, putting hand around my shoulder, back rubs, hand on waist, squeezing ass, neck massage, a subtle boob squeeze underneath my jacket, and holding hands; he couldn’t keep his hands off of me. His brothers didn’t seem to blink an eye / they were very nonchalant about it. \n\nHe initiated making plans for all of us to go to an amusement park next weekend (joined by the brothers’ wives), as well as going to a real hockey game together. \n\nThe next time I’m going to see him is this Friday evening at his place. \n\nThe only thing that possibly concerns me a bit is that this guy is a singer based in LA — he has a social media presence and that makes me insecure, especially when a lot of women follow him, etc. Like a “mini” celebrity. Perhaps I’m just insecure? \n\nAlso idk if this is worth mentioning, but his last relationship of 2.5 years ended 3 years ago when his ex-girlfriend cheated on him — with a woman. I can tell that scarred him. We don’t talk much about our past but that is one thing I do know. He hasn’t been in a relationship ever since. For me, I broke up with my exbf of 1 year (international long distance) only 2 weeks ago. Yes, I only met this guy 1 week after I broke up with my ex. He knows this. Ok well now all the cards are on the table! \n\nTLDR: Sorry if I sound thick, but what is going on? Does he seem to want a relationship? Are we more than casually dating? I plan on talking to him more seriously this Friday when I see him for the 5th time, but in the meantime any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. And again, hopefully this is my last post.

He's struggling with severe depression and I think I struggle with some codependency. He is addicted to speed and we both struggle with weed addiction.\u000b\n\nI have a strong opinion of how I wish to be treated in our relationship and those wishes are not always met. I don't know how to stick to my boundaries. They have been stretched after time I guess. I love him and I believe him when he says he will be better. But now is the time where I see there's a pattern here. History repeats itself... How long should I wait for improvement? I know I can't fix anybody but he really say that he want to improve. But I just can't seem to see any effort. Or at least long lasting effort. \n\nOur biggest relationship issue is that we have different views on time and appointments. I have been very clear with him that I don't tolerate any ditching. Due to his illness that has been a problem. Some days he just isn't in the mood and want to be alone. I can totally understand that he needs to be alone on those days and frankly, I don't want to be around him when he's in a bad mood either. But when he agrees a date with me, and then calls last minute to ditch, I can get very annoyed and frustrated with him. I try to explain that I would really like to be informed earlier so I can make other appointments. \n\nSaturday we had planned a date where I was going to cook dinner for him after he did some homework. He got in touch with me around 5 PM and asked if I wanted to go out with him and his friends later. I said sure I'd like that and asked him when he'd be hungry for dinner. He then told me one of the plans had to go and that he just put a pizza in the oven. I get frustrated and said we could do both, we could eat dinner and go meet his friends after. But he just didn't want to do that, because he hasn't started with his homework yet. I get frustrated that he has not planned ahead, and that he's now eating pizza, so I asked him when he planned to eat dinner with me. \n\nThen all hell breaks loose. He's now annoyed that I can't understand that he needs alone time. And I try to explain that's not the issue, the issue is that he's now eating pizza when we had a dinner date planned and that he clearly want to ditch those dinner plans to go out with his friends. He then said \"Fuck it I'm staying home\". Again I try to explain how I don't tolerate being ditched. He replies with a \"You should get your own hobbies and interest so you don't notice it\". And then I just get sad and want to reconsider the whole relationship after being attacked like that. When I state this, he explains that I should know when he's being dramatic (the \"Fuck it Im staying home\" part) and that he didn't mean it, and that we now have a disagreement on something that never happened (he ditching me). I'm still mad because 1. he DID say fuck it, and 2. he said something mean and 3. he's expecting me to know that he's not being serious when we have a serious discussion. \n\nThis all ends with breaking up, I say I can't handle being treated like this every time he's not in the mood and that I'm now going to block him to get some space. He agrees and is sorry for everything. I block him and cry, but deep down I know it's for the best.\n\nNow he's sent me an SMS where he apologies for everything, he is apologising for the mean thing he said and told me he loves me and respects me. He admits that he fucked up and that he's ashamed for what he said to me. He admits that he need to quit speed and weed and that he hope to become normal in a week or two. He said it's very sad if this has ruined the wonderful relationship we have together.\n\nI've seen this text before and frankly this is getting old. I just answered him that I love him but I need some time to think and that I feel I've just seen it too many times now... I love him so much and we do have a wonderful relationship except this thing. I'm willing to quit weed with him so I think I'm going to give this another chance, he seem more willing to fix this now than ever. I'm really scared of being alone so I just had to ask for other people's views on this. \n\nTLDR: Boyfriend is continuously ditching dates with me even after I've been clear with him I don't like it. I feel he's not very considerate of my feelings and have now broken up because of it.

He&#39;s struggling with severe depression and I think I struggle with some codependency. He is addicted to speed and we both struggle with weed addiction.</p>\n\n<p>I have a strong opinion of how I wish to be treated in our relationship and those wishes are not always met. I don&#39;t know how to stick to my boundaries. They have been stretched after time I guess. I love him and I believe him when he says he will be better. But now is the time where I see there&#39;s a pattern here. History repeats itself... How long should I wait for improvement? I know I can&#39;t fix anybody but he really say that he want to improve. But I just can&#39;t seem to see any effort. Or at least long lasting effort. </p>\n\n<p>Our biggest relationship issue is that we have different views on time and appointments. I have been very clear with him that I don&#39;t tolerate any ditching. Due to his illness that has been a problem. Some days he just isn&#39;t in the mood and want to be alone. I can totally understand that he needs to be alone on those days and frankly, I don&#39;t want to be around him when he&#39;s in a bad mood either. But when he agrees a date with me, and then calls last minute to ditch, I can get very annoyed and frustrated with him. I try to explain that I would really like to be informed earlier so I can make other appointments. </p>\n\n<p>Saturday we had planned a date where I was going to cook dinner for him after he did some homework. He got in touch with me around 5 PM and asked if I wanted to go out with him and his friends later. I said sure I&#39;d like that and asked him when he&#39;d be hungry for dinner. He then told me one of the plans had to go and that he just put a pizza in the oven. I get frustrated and said we could do both, we could eat dinner and go meet his friends after. But he just didn&#39;t want to do that, because he hasn&#39;t started with his homework yet. I get frustrated that he has not planned ahead, and that he&#39;s now eating pizza, so I asked him when he planned to eat dinner with me. </p>\n\n<p>Then all hell breaks loose. He&#39;s now annoyed that I can&#39;t understand that he needs alone time. And I try to explain that&#39;s not the issue, the issue is that he&#39;s now eating pizza when we had a dinner date planned and that he clearly want to ditch those dinner plans to go out with his friends. He then said &quot;Fuck it I&#39;m staying home&quot;. Again I try to explain how I don&#39;t tolerate being ditched. He replies with a &quot;You should get your own hobbies and interest so you don&#39;t notice it&quot;. And then I just get sad and want to reconsider the whole relationship after being attacked like that. When I state this, he explains that I should know when he&#39;s being dramatic (the &quot;Fuck it Im staying home&quot; part) and that he didn&#39;t mean it, and that we now have a disagreement on something that never happened (he ditching me). I&#39;m still mad because 1. he DID say fuck it, and 2. he said something mean and 3. he&#39;s expecting me to know that he&#39;s not being serious when we have a serious discussion. </p>\n\n<p>This all ends with breaking up, I say I can&#39;t handle being treated like this every time he&#39;s not in the mood and that I&#39;m now going to block him to get some space. He agrees and is sorry for everything. I block him and cry, but deep down I know it&#39;s for the best.</p>\n\n<p>Now he&#39;s sent me an SMS where he apologies for everything, he is apologising for the mean thing he said and told me he loves me and respects me. He admits that he fucked up and that he&#39;s ashamed for what he said to me. He admits that he need to quit speed and weed and that he hope to become normal in a week or two. He said it&#39;s very sad if this has ruined the wonderful relationship we have together.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve seen this text before and frankly this is getting old. I just answered him that I love him but I need some time to think and that I feel I&#39;ve just seen it too many times now... I love him so much and we do have a wonderful relationship except this thing. I&#39;m willing to quit weed with him so I think I&#39;m going to give this another chance, he seem more willing to fix this now than ever. I&#39;m really scared of being alone so I just had to ask for other people&#39;s views on this. </p>\n\n<p>TLDR: Boyfriend is continuously ditching dates with me even after I&#39;ve been clear with him I don&#39;t like it. I feel he&#39;s not very considerate of my feelings and have now broken up because of it. He&#39;s currently very apologetic and is now willing to stop doing drugs to see if it helps with his behaviour and don&#39;t want to break up. He has said these things before when we have had disagreements and I feel that history just keep repeating itself.

If I ignorantly say something wrong, please let me know. I'm trying to learn more about the trans community.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy fiancée (Lucy) has 3 siblings, the second youngest named Charlotte (but she goes by Charlie). She is openly bi (she came out a few years ago) but, as far as I know, has only had relationships with men. Charlie has struggled with her mental health in the past and has had a few traumatic experiences that have greatly affected her. A few months ago, Charlotte confessed to me that she thinks she is transgendered. She told me she has not her sister (Lucy) yet, but she wanted to tell me.\n\nOriginally (for wrong or for right), I took this with a grain of salt – she has said other things along the same vein before, and there was no follow-through on any of it. She often says things just for asn intense reaction, which most people end up just quietly/uncomfortably chuckling at and saying, \"Okay, Charlie\". Recently though, she’s been asking me for advice when it comes to dressing as a male, and other things that don’t seem as relevant to me because they're overly gendered already (colognes, accessories, hair styles, etc.). She also has had stereotypically feminine hobbies in the past, and now she’s asking me about my “manly” interests (many of which I think are not technically “manly” – working out, playing disc golf, videogames, etc) and is abandoning her old interests. She has been asking if I can collect old clothes for her to wear (including things like boxers).  She told me she is someday going to take hormones, but for the time-being, she is wearing traditionally male clothes in private. She also told me she is wearing something to make it look like she has male genitalia when she has clothes on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, for me, there are several things I’m conflicted about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirstly, I try to be an open-minded person, and within the 8 last years I have converted absolutely believing all forms of homosexuality are wrong, to becoming skeptical, to feeling bad about how I used to think and supporting all LGBTQ people (and becoming friends with many in the community along the way). I have not been vocal about it, however, because all of my family members have the mentality that I used to have (they think homosexuality is depraved).\n\nMaybe this is former belief causing ignorance, but I still wonder about transgenderism. I completely acknowledge that people who go through a full shift (hormones, surgeries, etc.) end up feeling more comfortable and happier after the transition is complete. But, I also have heard of scenarios where people do the full transition and end up feeling “wrong” still, and perhaps even worse. Maybe this is wrong, but I’m concerned that she would regret doing the hormones and whole surgery. I’m not sure. I wonder if this is her craving attention and doing what she can to get it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, it’s odd to me that she is trying to get into stereotypical male things – I dress slightly more “feminine” for a male (because I think gendered clothes are silly), but overall, I still have a masculine look. In my opinion, hobbies and clothes should not be gendered. I wonder why she is trying to get into videogames and everything when, at the core, these are not masculine activities. It makes me feel like she is unsure what being a man actually is, because it isn’t just hobbies and clothes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThirdly, she told her parents about it, and they are not pleased. Her dad is more open to it, but even still, her dad makes comments to suggest that he is not wanting to lose a daughter (from what Charlie told me). I think her mom is pretending like it’s not happening (her mom has similar beliefs to my family), or is hoping it is just a phase. Because of this, her mom has not made a big fuss about this. I wonder, though, if me giving Charlie my old clothes will upset the parents and siblings. I am trying to support her, but I also have my own reservations (listed above) and I don’t want to upset her family. Charlie is also very talkative, so I’m wondering if she has already told her dad that I am “helping her” (but I am trying to be neutrally supportive at this stage). I’m not sure if I should reach out to her dad and talk to him about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFourthly, she told me this is something she's been considering since October, when she dressed up as a guy for Halloween. I feel, normally, when someone is transgender, it's something that is in their mind for their whole life. I don't know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, she has not told Lucy (my fiancée) yet. I ended up getting really drunk and breaking down and telling Lucy because I felt so bad keeping it from her (which was absolutely wrong of me, I know).

If I ignorantly say something wrong, please let me know. I&#39;m trying to learn more about the trans community.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>My fiancée (Lucy) has 3 siblings, the second youngest named Charlotte (but she goes by Charlie). She is openly bi (she came out a few years ago) but, as far as I know, has only had relationships with men. Charlie has struggled with her mental health in the past and has had a few traumatic experiences that have greatly affected her. A few months ago, Charlotte confessed to me that she thinks she is transgendered. She told me she has not her sister (Lucy) yet, but she wanted to tell me.</p>\n\n<p>Originally (for wrong or for right), I took this with a grain of salt – she has said other things along the same vein before, and there was no follow-through on any of it. She often says things just for asn intense reaction, which most people end up just quietly/uncomfortably chuckling at and saying, &quot;Okay, Charlie&quot;. Recently though, she’s been asking me for advice when it comes to dressing as a male, and other things that don’t seem as relevant to me because they&#39;re overly gendered already (colognes, accessories, hair styles, etc.). She also has had stereotypically feminine hobbies in the past, and now she’s asking me about my “manly” interests (many of which I think are not technically “manly” – working out, playing disc golf, videogames, etc) and is abandoning her old interests. She has been asking if I can collect old clothes for her to wear (including things like boxers).  She told me she is someday going to take hormones, but for the time-being, she is wearing traditionally male clothes in private. She also told me she is wearing something to make it look like she has male genitalia when she has clothes on.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Now, for me, there are several things I’m conflicted about.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, I try to be an open-minded person, and within the 8 last years I have converted absolutely believing all forms of homosexuality are wrong, to becoming skeptical, to feeling bad about how I used to think and supporting all LGBTQ people (and becoming friends with many in the community along the way). I have not been vocal about it, however, because all of my family members have the mentality that I used to have (they think homosexuality is depraved).</p>\n\n<p>Maybe this is former belief causing ignorance, but I still wonder about transgenderism. I completely acknowledge that people who go through a full shift (hormones, surgeries, etc.) end up feeling more comfortable and happier after the transition is complete. But, I also have heard of scenarios where people do the full transition and end up feeling “wrong” still, and perhaps even worse. Maybe this is wrong, but I’m concerned that she would regret doing the hormones and whole surgery. I’m not sure. I wonder if this is her craving attention and doing what she can to get it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, it’s odd to me that she is trying to get into stereotypical male things – I dress slightly more “feminine” for a male (because I think gendered clothes are silly), but overall, I still have a masculine look. In my opinion, hobbies and clothes should not be gendered. I wonder why she is trying to get into videogames and everything when, at the core, these are not masculine activities. It makes me feel like she is unsure what being a man actually is, because it isn’t just hobbies and clothes.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, she told her parents about it, and they are not pleased. Her dad is more open to it, but even still, her dad makes comments to suggest that he is not wanting to lose a daughter (from what Charlie told me). I think her mom is pretending like it’s not happening (her mom has similar beliefs to my family), or is hoping it is just a phase. Because of this, her mom has not made a big fuss about this. I wonder, though, if me giving Charlie my old clothes will upset the parents and siblings. I am trying to support her, but I also have my own reservations (listed above) and I don’t want to upset her family. Charlie is also very talkative, so I’m wondering if she has already told her dad that I am “helping her” (but I am trying to be neutrally supportive at this stage). I’m not sure if I should reach out to her dad and talk to him about it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Fourthly, she told me this is something she&#39;s been considering since October, when she dressed up as a guy for Halloween. I feel, normally, when someone is transgender, it&#39;s something that is in their mind for their whole life. I don&#39;t know.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, she has not told Lucy (my fiancée) yet. I ended up getting really drunk and breaking down and telling Lucy because I felt so bad keeping it from her (which was absolutely wrong of me, I know). I told my fiancée not to tell Charlie that I know, because I want Charlie to tell her when she feels comfortable. But my fiancée seems to think that it’s just “Charlie being Charlie” and told me to ignore her. I haven’t told my fiancée about her wanting me to collect male clothes, because I don’t want to out Charlie more than I already have.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>And, to be completely honest, I’m not sure why she reached out to me about it.

For example, she has told me my hair is &quot;hot&quot; and tried to feel my muscles.</p>\n\n<p>Any advice is appreciated, and I’m very sorry if any of this is insensitive.

At first it was fine - he participated when we played games, when he does speak not many people listen expect A and I, and he's generally been pretty chill. But recently he's been acting a bit weird.\n\nWe play a game where we flip a milk carton and say something. If the milk lands, then the thing we said comes true. When it was QK's turn, he said, \"If this lands then one of you at this table have to have sex with me!\" which I found odd but shrugged off.\n\nLater the same week, we played a similar game. Someone throws a carton of milk and says \"whoever doesn't catch this (ex. has a third nipple)\" and everyone tries to catch it. When it was QK's turn he said something I didn't hear and threw the milk. Everyone went for it and I caught it. I asked QK what he said, he (excitedly) explained \"I said whoever ***does*** catch this milk has to have sex with me!\". I kinda just shrugged it off, but I still feel pretty weird.\n\nFor some of the more general but probably not as weird stuff I noticed, he sometimes sits a bit close. At my school the lunch chairs are directly attached to the table, so you can't really move them. So usually A saves a seat for her boyfriend and I sit next to her.

At first it was fine - he participated when we played games, when he does speak not many people listen expect A and I, and he&#39;s generally been pretty chill. But recently he&#39;s been acting a bit weird.</p>\n\n<p>We play a game where we flip a milk carton and say something. If the milk lands, then the thing we said comes true. When it was QK&#39;s turn, he said, &quot;If this lands then one of you at this table have to have sex with me!&quot; which I found odd but shrugged off.</p>\n\n<p>Later the same week, we played a similar game. Someone throws a carton of milk and says &quot;whoever doesn&#39;t catch this (ex. has a third nipple)&quot; and everyone tries to catch it. When it was QK&#39;s turn he said something I didn&#39;t hear and threw the milk. Everyone went for it and I caught it. I asked QK what he said, he (excitedly) explained &quot;I said whoever <strong><em>does</em></strong> catch this milk has to have sex with me!&quot;. I kinda just shrugged it off, but I still feel pretty weird.</p>\n\n<p>For some of the more general but probably not as weird stuff I noticed, he sometimes sits a bit close. At my school the lunch chairs are directly attached to the table, so you can&#39;t really move them. So usually A saves a seat for her boyfriend and I sit next to her.

Double standard. And I suspect that he might be cheating on me. \n\n\n\nWe’ve been dating for 2 years now. We somehow live together. I do all the housework — sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, dusting, washing the plates and every other thing. He just sits there and watches tv or he’ll use his phone. Whenever I tell him to help me out a little, he’s reply will ALWAYS be “I’ll do it tomorrow”. \n\nHe loves to cook, and I enjoy eating the food he cooks, but there are several foods I do not eat but he forces me to eat them if I refuse to, he’ll say shit like “look who’s being a baby, being all picky about food.” \n\nWhenever we quarrel, he’ll always raise his voice. Normally I do not tell him how I feel towards him because he gets angry easily, furthermore his replies will always be “you’re upset? What makes you think I’m not upset by it?” “You don’t like it? What makes you think I like it?” He is always comparing my feelings with his, he does not understand everyone feels differently. Whenever I breakdown and I cry really badly he just sits down there with his arms crossed looking at me as if I’m an animal in an enclosure. \n\nHe talks to me as if I’m an idiot, he always speaks in a condescending manner eg. “do you understand what I’m saying?” “I’m asking you yes or no”. \n\nHe pisses me off all the time by mimicking the way I speak, thinking it’s a joke. And when I get pissed off he’ll say things like “lmao look who’s being a baby, unable to handle jokes.” “What a fucked up attitude” he always snatch my phone away from my hands to see what I’m doing, and last night I was in the middle of switching apps he insisted that I deleted an app and I was talking to someone else but I was actually on AliExpress buying nail products for my salon. \n\nMy previous boyfriend cheated on me with this particular girl, let’s name her Beverley. My boyfriend used to contact Beverley quite a bit since they were friends back in middle school. I’ve mentioned it to him on several occasions that I feel uncomfortable over the fact that they’re contacting one another considering she knew that he is my boyfriend. He assured me that they don’t speak to one another anymore, but recently I saw her tagging him in her Instagram stories, he did not mention it to me until I saw it myself. I asked him why did she tag you, his reply was “I don’t know.” I told him to unfollow her but he is unwilling to, he kept telling me “we’re just friends and it’ll be awkward if he unfollows her.” Whenever I’m scrolling through my Instagram page if he sees a man posting pictures he’ll tell me to unfollow him and I have to do it with no questions asked. \n\n\nWhenever he’s out with his friends, he takes a few hours to reply me.

Double standard. And I suspect that he might be cheating on me. </p>\n\n<p>We’ve been dating for 2 years now. We somehow live together. I do all the housework — sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, dusting, washing the plates and every other thing. He just sits there and watches tv or he’ll use his phone. Whenever I tell him to help me out a little, he’s reply will ALWAYS be “I’ll do it tomorrow”. </p>\n\n<p>He loves to cook, and I enjoy eating the food he cooks, but there are several foods I do not eat but he forces me to eat them if I refuse to, he’ll say shit like “look who’s being a baby, being all picky about food.” </p>\n\n<p>Whenever we quarrel, he’ll always raise his voice. Normally I do not tell him how I feel towards him because he gets angry easily, furthermore his replies will always be “you’re upset? What makes you think I’m not upset by it?” “You don’t like it? What makes you think I like it?” He is always comparing my feelings with his, he does not understand everyone feels differently. Whenever I breakdown and I cry really badly he just sits down there with his arms crossed looking at me as if I’m an animal in an enclosure. </p>\n\n<p>He talks to me as if I’m an idiot, he always speaks in a condescending manner eg. “do you understand what I’m saying?” “I’m asking you yes or no”. </p>\n\n<p>He pisses me off all the time by mimicking the way I speak, thinking it’s a joke. And when I get pissed off he’ll say things like “lmao look who’s being a baby, unable to handle jokes.” “What a fucked up attitude” he always snatch my phone away from my hands to see what I’m doing, and last night I was in the middle of switching apps he insisted that I deleted an app and I was talking to someone else but I was actually on AliExpress buying nail products for my salon. </p>\n\n<p>My previous boyfriend cheated on me with this particular girl, let’s name her Beverley. My boyfriend used to contact Beverley quite a bit since they were friends back in middle school. I’ve mentioned it to him on several occasions that I feel uncomfortable over the fact that they’re contacting one another considering she knew that he is my boyfriend. He assured me that they don’t speak to one another anymore, but recently I saw her tagging him in her Instagram stories, he did not mention it to me until I saw it myself. I asked him why did she tag you, his reply was “I don’t know.” I told him to unfollow her but he is unwilling to, he kept telling me “we’re just friends and it’ll be awkward if he unfollows her.” Whenever I’m scrolling through my Instagram page if he sees a man posting pictures he’ll tell me to unfollow him and I have to do it with no questions asked. </p>\n\n<p>Whenever he’s out with his friends, he takes a few hours to reply me. He never once offered me to hang out with them. But whenever I go out with my friends he keeps texting me, kept calling me if I didn’t reply him in 10 minutes. Told me to send him pictures to prove that I’m with my girl friends and there is no other man. </p>\n\n<p>I know he’s going through my phone when I’m asleep. I am not sure why is he doing that.

This is literally delusion. I'm not even kidding. She sees what her dad does, then put my name in it come and accuse me of it. \n\nHas anyone had any unique experience similar to this? What exactly am I supposed to do with this situation? Like she sees the fked up stuff her dad is doing, then she assumes in her small brain that \"OK , ALL MEN MuST BE LIKE THIS\" and come fight with me over what his dad does, just claim I'm doing it too !!!!

His dad also has a terrible taste when it comes to women. So for instance, he is into this 18 yr old prostitute he found in TJ. Now none of this would have been my business had it not been for my GF accusing me of doing everything her dad does!!!</p>\n\n<p>So it&#39;s not just that my GF accuses me of cheating and having 4 girlfriends, but also that the women and things she accuses me off is what pisses me off the most. It&#39;s not like she accuses me off of cheating with some worthy woman, she basically accuses me of cheating with a janitor or something in those line. No disrespect for janitors or anyone. But get what I&#39;m saying. Like she accuses me of cheating with a girl, that if you take that girl and show it to any of my friends and family, they will all laugh at you for claiming I&#39;m into this type of girl with this type of fked up personality and look. But then my GF insists that I like this girl. Like imagine the girl is so low, that even if I was single and stuck in a desert, I would still not go for this girl. </p>\n\n<p>But this is how I know it&#39;s my GF extending her experience of her dad to include me. When her dad buy the 18 yr old prostitute Gf of his some gift, my GF suddenly come and accuse me of buying the janitor girl gifts. Which is insane. because now not only you&#39;re claiming I like a janitor, but you&#39;re also claiming I like this janitor so much that I buy expensive bags n stuff for her. Which is insane. This is literally delusion. I&#39;m not even kidding. She sees what her dad does, then put my name in it come and accuse me of it. </p>\n\n<p>Has anyone had any unique experience similar to this? What exactly am I supposed to do with this situation? Like she sees the fked up stuff her dad is doing, then she assumes in her small brain that &quot;OK , ALL MEN MuST BE LIKE THIS&quot; and come fight with me over what his dad does, just claim I&#39;m doing it too !!!!

About a year and a half ago, I introduced my best friend and roommate, B, to a casual friend of mine, D, knowing that neither of them were looking for anything serious and would both be attracted to each other. I wouldn't have ever expected either of them to date, but lo and behold, after that first night he never left our house. About 3 months in, my boyfriend at the time calls me saying D's family is looking for him because his son was just born. I was with B and asked her if she even knew that D was going to have a baby. We were both floored because D had been at our house earlier that day and had left in a sort of weird and hurried manner. B was hurt and shocked but decided to look past it as D explained to her that he was worried that she wouldn't even be interested in him at all if he told her he had a baby on the way. He also told her that he was still married to the baby mama but was working on getting a divorce. \n\nThey continue dating, I move out of state and she moves back in with her parents. D has an apartment but for some reason prefers to stay with B at her parents house. I get texts almost daily from B while I'm gone saying that D barely touches her, he won't tell her he loves her after a year of dating, at some points he won't talk to her and he gets angry when she tries to talk about the issues that they're having or tries to show affection, and he also never lets her see his kid. I try to tell her that he's using her for rides and food because he doesn't have a car and he doesn't make much money at his job. She insists that she loves him and they're meant to be together and blah blah blah. When I moved back after being gone a year, I saw how terribly he treated her, and heard the abusive things he would say to her and again tried to get her to leave. They ended up breaking up around this past Thanksgiving but only for about a month. \n\nWhen they got back together he was acting completely different. He told her he loved her, he got a good job, he was making plans with her and including his kid. Then about a month ago, his wife (that he had never divorced) texts B's mom with multiple screenshots showing that D had been cheating on B within the time that they had gotten back together after their short breakup. B is devastated, doesn't talk to D for a few days but for some reason refuses to cut contact with him. At this point, D starts acting desperate, writing her long letters every day telling her how much he loves her and can't live without her, showing up at her job (she works at a restaurant) and hanging around until she gets off of work, and showing up at the bars he knows she frequents (he actually got kicked out of one of these bars for hitting a friend of his bc they said they were tired of hearing his sob story. This is important later). B is kind of weirded out but I can tell that she likes the attention because he had never acted anything like this the whole time they were dating. All the while her other friends and I are telling her it wouldn't be a bad idea to get a restraining order on him. \n\nEverything came to a head one night about 2 weeks ago. B texted me asking me if I would go hang out at her work because D was there and was drunk despite the fact that he wasn't supposed to be drinking on his antidepressants. I went up and D was terribly drunk, just sitting at the bar of the restaurant staring at B and going back and forth between the restaurant and the bar next door. He tried speaking to me and after I told him I didn't want to talk to him, he began yelling \"I'm sorry\" over and over again across the bar of the restaurant. When B got off of work I told D he needed to go home and leave us alone and B and I went to the bar next door for a drink. D walks in shortly after so we decided to go to the bar from which he was banned. I told B I was going to meet her there and after about 10 min of her not showing up I called her and she said she had brought D home bc she didn't want him driving but when they got to his place, he wouldn't get out of her car. I told her I was going to call the cops and she begged me not to. She finally called me back about 5 min later saying he had gotten out and she was on the way. Fast forward about 20 minutes, we're sitting at the bar and the bartender hands her a shot of liquor that she would typically take with D. We joked saying what if he was there and had sent her the shot but agreed the bartender would have kicked him out. Lo and behold, I look at the end of the bar and D is sitting there looking at us with a creepy smile, a jacket pulled up around his neck, and a hat pulled down low. The poor bartender was new and did not know that he was banned, so I quickly informed her despite B's protests (I don't know why she was protesting). I watched D get into an Uber and drive away. B and I left the bar shortly after, and when she arrived home she called me saying D was at her house and had snuck in when she let her dog out. I told her to either call the cops or wake her parents up bc he is stalking her. I tried to call her mom but got no answer bc it was the middle of the night. She let him stay in her room and she slept on the couch, and when she got up for class in the morning, D walked out of the room and her dad saw that he was there. He was pissed and they both left and locked D out of the house. \n\nI get a call around noon that day from B saying that D's mom called her and they were worried D had killed himself as he had told everyone he loved them and then wouldn't answer his phone for the last several hours. The last place he had told anyone he was was at B's house so D's mom was heading to the house with a pastor. I checked his ig story and it said \"it's been real everyone\".  B called me back a bit later and said when she got home from class D was sitting in the driveway talking to the pastor. He had never left her house and had tied a noose around their basketball goal. They brought him to the psych ward and he was there for at least a week. Now B is almost acting as if absolutely nothing has happened.

She keeps inviting D around when we get together as just girls without asking or telling us ahead of time, she invited him to celebrate Mardi Gras with us without mentioning to me that he would be there, she tried to invite him to a get together at one of my friends houses that I was bringing her along to...it's just ridiculous. She keeps telling us to just get over it, it's her choice to be with him and we need to be his friend. I don't know what to do. I think he's not a good person and he's not someone I want to be friends with. I have a hard time being nice to him when I see him and he barely even acknowledges me anymore anyway, as he sees me as a threat to his relationship with B because I'm honest with her about how I feel about him. I don't want to lose my friendship with her but I also don't want to encourage her relationship with him.

About a year and a half ago, I introduced my best friend and roommate, B, to a casual friend of mine, D, knowing that neither of them were looking for anything serious and would both be attracted to each other. I wouldn&#39;t have ever expected either of them to date, but lo and behold, after that first night he never left our house. About 3 months in, my boyfriend at the time calls me saying D&#39;s family is looking for him because his son was just born. I was with B and asked her if she even knew that D was going to have a baby. We were both floored because D had been at our house earlier that day and had left in a sort of weird and hurried manner. B was hurt and shocked but decided to look past it as D explained to her that he was worried that she wouldn&#39;t even be interested in him at all if he told her he had a baby on the way. He also told her that he was still married to the baby mama but was working on getting a divorce. </p>\n\n<p>They continue dating, I move out of state and she moves back in with her parents. D has an apartment but for some reason prefers to stay with B at her parents house. I get texts almost daily from B while I&#39;m gone saying that D barely touches her, he won&#39;t tell her he loves her after a year of dating, at some points he won&#39;t talk to her and he gets angry when she tries to talk about the issues that they&#39;re having or tries to show affection, and he also never lets her see his kid. I try to tell her that he&#39;s using her for rides and food because he doesn&#39;t have a car and he doesn&#39;t make much money at his job. She insists that she loves him and they&#39;re meant to be together and blah blah blah. When I moved back after being gone a year, I saw how terribly he treated her, and heard the abusive things he would say to her and again tried to get her to leave. They ended up breaking up around this past Thanksgiving but only for about a month. </p>\n\n<p>When they got back together he was acting completely different. He told her he loved her, he got a good job, he was making plans with her and including his kid. Then about a month ago, his wife (that he had never divorced) texts B&#39;s mom with multiple screenshots showing that D had been cheating on B within the time that they had gotten back together after their short breakup. B is devastated, doesn&#39;t talk to D for a few days but for some reason refuses to cut contact with him. At this point, D starts acting desperate, writing her long letters every day telling her how much he loves her and can&#39;t live without her, showing up at her job (she works at a restaurant) and hanging around until she gets off of work, and showing up at the bars he knows she frequents (he actually got kicked out of one of these bars for hitting a friend of his bc they said they were tired of hearing his sob story. This is important later). B is kind of weirded out but I can tell that she likes the attention because he had never acted anything like this the whole time they were dating. All the while her other friends and I are telling her it wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea to get a restraining order on him. </p>\n\n<p>Everything came to a head one night about 2 weeks ago. B texted me asking me if I would go hang out at her work because D was there and was drunk despite the fact that he wasn&#39;t supposed to be drinking on his antidepressants. I went up and D was terribly drunk, just sitting at the bar of the restaurant staring at B and going back and forth between the restaurant and the bar next door. He tried speaking to me and after I told him I didn&#39;t want to talk to him, he began yelling &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; over and over again across the bar of the restaurant. When B got off of work I told D he needed to go home and leave us alone and B and I went to the bar next door for a drink. D walks in shortly after so we decided to go to the bar from which he was banned. I told B I was going to meet her there and after about 10 min of her not showing up I called her and she said she had brought D home bc she didn&#39;t want him driving but when they got to his place, he wouldn&#39;t get out of her car. I told her I was going to call the cops and she begged me not to. She finally called me back about 5 min later saying he had gotten out and she was on the way. Fast forward about 20 minutes, we&#39;re sitting at the bar and the bartender hands her a shot of liquor that she would typically take with D. We joked saying what if he was there and had sent her the shot but agreed the bartender would have kicked him out. Lo and behold, I look at the end of the bar and D is sitting there looking at us with a creepy smile, a jacket pulled up around his neck, and a hat pulled down low. The poor bartender was new and did not know that he was banned, so I quickly informed her despite B&#39;s protests (I don&#39;t know why she was protesting). I watched D get into an Uber and drive away. B and I left the bar shortly after, and when she arrived home she called me saying D was at her house and had snuck in when she let her dog out. I told her to either call the cops or wake her parents up bc he is stalking her. I tried to call her mom but got no answer bc it was the middle of the night. She let him stay in her room and she slept on the couch, and when she got up for class in the morning, D walked out of the room and her dad saw that he was there. He was pissed and they both left and locked D out of the house. </p>\n\n<p>I get a call around noon that day from B saying that D&#39;s mom called her and they were worried D had killed himself as he had told everyone he loved them and then wouldn&#39;t answer his phone for the last several hours. The last place he had told anyone he was was at B&#39;s house so D&#39;s mom was heading to the house with a pastor. I checked his ig story and it said &quot;it&#39;s been real everyone&quot;.  B called me back a bit later and said when she got home from class D was sitting in the driveway talking to the pastor. He had never left her house and had tied a noose around their basketball goal. They brought him to the psych ward and he was there for at least a week. Now B is almost acting as if absolutely nothing has happened.

We had a super adventurous relationship (traveling, camping) and really got along in values. However, he was set to move since early on so we didn't get really emotional and honest until the last couple of months. In many ways it was a \"vacation relationship\", but we did spend about half the week together.\n\nWe were also in an open relationship, initiated by him. As far as I know he never dated others due to lack of time/interest. He just liked the option. The last month of our relationship I started dating someone, all were happy with polyamory. Then my ex moved and I became monogamous with my current boyfriend a couple months later.  \n\nNow I've been dating my current boyfriend for 6 months. We're very serious and loving and essentially live together. We have similar values, though recently I've had some lifestyle doubts that I don't know if they're valid or stemming from mourning/missing my ex. Edit: in a way, I feel like I miss what I could have had with my ex (an active relationship with similar lifestyle) though I deeply appreciate what I have with my boyfriend (a soulmate type relationship with slightly different lifestyles). \n\nI've never relationship \"hopped\" so quickly and never expected this relationship to become so serious so quickly. FWIW I usually have 7 months to over a year in between relationships, and this was my second poly relationship (if temporarily). It's lovely and so deep, but I do find myself mourning my ex at times. It doesn't feel appropriate because I love my boyfriend. But, things didn't end with ex because of a lack of love. I'm having a hard time letting go of my ex and its standing in the way of my current relationship. \n\nThere are a few things my ex had that I miss in my current relationship. My ex and I had similar values towards exercise (fitness), food(healthy, simple), the environment(less gas and plastic), and were similarly easy-going. I don't know if I miss these aspects because I need them OR if it's just because of the fast turn between relationships so it's more dramatic that these aspects aren't there.\n\nIt's to the point where my boyfriend is discussing moving in together (in 4 months) and I can't decide. I love him, but I want to be with someone who loves the outdoors and takes care of their physical health. At the same time, my boyfriend is very caring, intelligent, talkative, extraverted, and many other positives which were not present to the same extent with my ex. It's also winter, and I feel like he's more active in the summer and we'd have more chance for adventures of our own.\n\nI just feel very confused. My boyfriend is wonderful and such a fantastic support. We laugh constantly. My ex was wonderful and had a lifestyle which was more in line with my own.

We had a super adventurous relationship (traveling, camping) and really got along in values. However, he was set to move since early on so we didn&#39;t get really emotional and honest until the last couple of months. In many ways it was a &quot;vacation relationship&quot;, but we did spend about half the week together.</p>\n\n<p>We were also in an open relationship, initiated by him. As far as I know he never dated others due to lack of time/interest. He just liked the option. The last month of our relationship I started dating someone, all were happy with polyamory. Then my ex moved and I became monogamous with my current boyfriend a couple months later.  </p>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;ve been dating my current boyfriend for 6 months. We&#39;re very serious and loving and essentially live together. We have similar values, though recently I&#39;ve had some lifestyle doubts that I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re valid or stemming from mourning/missing my ex. Edit: in a way, I feel like I miss what I could have had with my ex (an active relationship with similar lifestyle) though I deeply appreciate what I have with my boyfriend (a soulmate type relationship with slightly different lifestyles). </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve never relationship &quot;hopped&quot; so quickly and never expected this relationship to become so serious so quickly. FWIW I usually have 7 months to over a year in between relationships, and this was my second poly relationship (if temporarily). It&#39;s lovely and so deep, but I do find myself mourning my ex at times. It doesn&#39;t feel appropriate because I love my boyfriend. But, things didn&#39;t end with ex because of a lack of love. I&#39;m having a hard time letting go of my ex and its standing in the way of my current relationship. </p>\n\n<p>There are a few things my ex had that I miss in my current relationship. My ex and I had similar values towards exercise (fitness), food(healthy, simple), the environment(less gas and plastic), and were similarly easy-going. I don&#39;t know if I miss these aspects because I need them OR if it&#39;s just because of the fast turn between relationships so it&#39;s more dramatic that these aspects aren&#39;t there.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s to the point where my boyfriend is discussing moving in together (in 4 months) and I can&#39;t decide. I love him, but I want to be with someone who loves the outdoors and takes care of their physical health. At the same time, my boyfriend is very caring, intelligent, talkative, extraverted, and many other positives which were not present to the same extent with my ex. It&#39;s also winter, and I feel like he&#39;s more active in the summer and we&#39;d have more chance for adventures of our own.</p>\n\n<p>I just feel very confused. My boyfriend is wonderful and such a fantastic support. We laugh constantly. My ex was wonderful and had a lifestyle which was more in line with my own. I can&#39;t imagine breaking up with my boyfriend, but at the same time it feels like such a disservice to date him when I feel this torch for my ex.</p>\n\n<p>Any advice?</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Poly relationship turned monogamous, but I still miss my ex and love my now monogamous boyfriend.

Cuddling, kissing and making up for lost sleep while watching movies. I cooked her dinner and we had a big chat on the couch. We previously noted that I was far more ready for a relationship than she was (I have been single for 9 months and her only 1) and that she needed her time.

My fear here is, I know she wants to go out with her friends, perhaps sleep around a bit and to live her life without worrying about someone else's feelings. But I really like this girl, and I could say that I would happily live my life with her (and no, I didn't wait 3 years for this. I did get over her completely, I didn't hold out for our remeeting, this whole thing is us meeting and having grown so much and developing feelings again).

It's fully up to her and that is terrifying for me having caught feelings and then having to supress them holding out for something that may never happen. I told her that we may miss our chance, she replied that we are always attracted to each other, is it possible for us to miss our shot? or Does that just delay us getting together.

He has a lot of problems with showing affection, and it has been harder and harder for me to cope with it. Every time I say something like “I love you” or “I miss you” he never says it back, in fact he never has. And i’ve talked to him about him not showing affection and it bothering me at times, but yesterday it felt as if I reached a limit on tolerating this, and so I talked to him about it today. He is traveling for the week (possibly the month) because of job interviews, so this conversation was via facetime. I told him how bad it made me feel, how I felt like the relationship was almost one sided (also because of some other factors, such as him not sharing small simply things I feel people in relationships would share. f.ex: he went to his native country for a job interview and decided to surprise his parents by going to his home town without their knowledge, I only found this out after it had happened, and not because he intentionally told me, but because I asked him what he did that day since he was extremely unavailable and almost not answering my messages) and that I was beginning to feel extremely stupid for saying that I love him or/and miss him since he never says it to me. His response was first to deny any of it, saying it isn’t true. Afterwards he said that we have talked about it, and he simply is a more closed person. He then proceeded to say that none of his 3 exes changed this about him, nor was his parents able to, and then added that it isn’t something he ever sees changing. He then said that I could either continue like this, or that I could simply just stop showing him as much affection if it made me feel stupid, since he didn’t show it back. I answered saying that in a relationship people don’t need to change completely for one another, but that they need to be willing to compromise and meet halfway. The conversation ended with him saying he’ll think about it, but the problem is that these conversations always end like that with him, but without any follow-up conversation nor any changes in behavior. \n\nThe only solution I am able to see now is to break up.

He has a lot of problems with showing affection, and it has been harder and harder for me to cope with it. Every time I say something like “I love you” or “I miss you” he never says it back, in fact he never has. And i’ve talked to him about him not showing affection and it bothering me at times, but yesterday it felt as if I reached a limit on tolerating this, and so I talked to him about it today. He is traveling for the week (possibly the month) because of job interviews, so this conversation was via facetime. I told him how bad it made me feel, how I felt like the relationship was almost one sided (also because of some other factors, such as him not sharing small simply things I feel people in relationships would share. f.ex: he went to his native country for a job interview and decided to surprise his parents by going to his home town without their knowledge, I only found this out after it had happened, and not because he intentionally told me, but because I asked him what he did that day since he was extremely unavailable and almost not answering my messages) and that I was beginning to feel extremely stupid for saying that I love him or/and miss him since he never says it to me. His response was first to deny any of it, saying it isn’t true. Afterwards he said that we have talked about it, and he simply is a more closed person. He then proceeded to say that none of his 3 exes changed this about him, nor was his parents able to, and then added that it isn’t something he ever sees changing. He then said that I could either continue like this, or that I could simply just stop showing him as much affection if it made me feel stupid, since he didn’t show it back. I answered saying that in a relationship people don’t need to change completely for one another, but that they need to be willing to compromise and meet halfway. The conversation ended with him saying he’ll think about it, but the problem is that these conversations always end like that with him, but without any follow-up conversation nor any changes in behavior. </p>\n\n<p>The only solution I am able to see now is to break up.

I wouldn’t give her some information she wanted to know, and she just texted my roommate.

I felt like a teenager that doesn’t want her mom to come to school with her and talk to all her friends or sth.\n\nAfter my angry voice messages, I texted her that I’m annoyed that she would do this again so easily after it was a big problem for me last time, especially since we had been getting along really well recently.

Obviously she doesn’t see it as a big deal and thinks I’m overreacting but to me it’s about the principle of her just not respecting my boundaries if they’re inconvenient for her. I replied later that day “How about you apologize and see (if it’s better now)”, she replied “sorry”. I told her that “sorry” doesn’t cut it because this is at least the second time she has done this, and that I don’t believe that she feels bad about doing it again, to which she just replied “okay”. That was yesterday.\n\nHer replying “okay” tells me that, yes, she’s not sorry and she doesn’t feel bad, and if she feels like it, she’ll just do it again. Like I said above, the “substance” of our argument this time, isn’t a huge deal, but I am hurt that she seems to just not care, and I don’t feel like talking to her to be vulnerable and explain myself again if that’s her mind set.\n\nI’m just tired this seemingly endless cycle of me reinvesting in her emotionally, only for us to be in the same situation again in a few weeks or months. I’ve thought many times, that if she wasn’t my sister, I would just cut her off, because I would not be sitting on this lame roller-coaster of disappointment and hurt feels if I had a choice, but alas, we are related and when we do get along it feels really good. She's a good person, we have the same humor, etc...

It's not like he entertains it and he's a great boyfriend so I trust him, but I know that the only reason she would do that is bc she's waiting/urging him to keep his options open. I've asked him to unfollow her and he's agreed to do it w/o any issues but wow I feel horrible and guilty for asking.

info that's pertinent:** i had a tumultuous teenage stage where i was definitely a problem child. i had issues with alcohol and having some serious bouts of anorexia, bulimia, and EDNOS (eating disorder not otherwise specified) that resulted in 3 hospitalizations to get my health on track. when i would drink, i would become a very angry person in regards to my parents, often fighting with them when i came home from whatever havoc i was wreaking. this resulted in screaming matches and trauma for both my parents and myself. this continued into my early twenties, especially during my very physically and emotionally abusive 3 year relationship. once i finally got out of that situation, i drastically cleaned up my act, refraining from excessive drinking or any other behavior that would result in negative effects. i still have a tricky relationship with food, but i haven't been at an unhealthy weight in 4 years. i am also a lot more mellow now, i make good decisions, i don't hang out with people that i could get into tricky predicaments with, i don't come home drunk, i don't do drugs (never did drugs, except for weed, but that never elicited any problems with anyone). i am still in college (i took off 3 years and switched majors) and live at home with my mom, dad, and dog. i realize i am EXTREMELY privileged to have such amazing and unconditional love and support (emotionally, financially, and with my interests and schooling). my relationship with my parents has drastically improved, i follow all rules they set (minimal, mostly \"be considerate\" types of things; let them know where i am, when i'm coming home, who i'm with, etc.), and we do not have any big blow ups anymore because i am a much better person and daughter since i've grown up and gone through therapy.\n\n**the current issues with my dad:** while my father has a nasty temper, we get along. the only issue i have with my father is that he tracks my every financial move since he has access to my mobile banking. up until a few months ago, he also tracked my phone location very closely (he is now retired and has nothing to focus on but me, golf, and his television shows). this resulted in several problems. for example, a few months ago, i dropped my friend off at her grandparents' house before i went to class at 7:30 am. my mother knew i was doing this, but i neglected to tell my father because the information didn't seem very important and he wasn't awake before i left. after i dropped her off, i went on my way to school. i stopped at a stop sign which happened to be right next to a liquor store. mind you, this is around 7:45 in the morning and the liquor store was NOT OPEN. he called me in a rage accusing me of going to the liquor store, which obviously made me very upset since he refused to believe me. at that point i had to pull over. i sent him a screen shot of the liquor store website with the hours clearly stating that it did not open until 10 am and he still would not stop yelling and being accusatory. i called my mother who was very angry with my father for being so irrational and making me cry and panicked while driving (i have about an hour long commute to school). she in turn called him and diffused the situation, but it was really, really upsetting to me, especially because i had not had even a sip of alcohol in over a year, and did not have any anger or alcohol fueled confrontations for a much longer period. another example is when i was visiting a friend at an apartment complex he and his father were renovating and he was staying in (so that squatters wouldn't break in), in a moderately shady part of town. i was completely safe though, he walked me to and from my car which was parked directly in from of the complex. my father called me again in a rage and forced me to leave. i am 26 years old. i feel like this is completely irrational and **EXTREMELY embarrassing**. i was never doing anything wrong and my father would needlessly and religiously checked my location and charges at all times. thankfully, my parents no longer track my location and things have improved. but i have still extreme anxiety about going to innocuous places with my friends. i also feel like it's hard for me to date because i don't always want to tell my parents that i'm going to hang out with someone from tinder. i'm 26 and feel like i don't even have sexual freedom because my parents want to know EVERYTHING. i feel like i can't even go to a pub for lunch because my dad will see that i went to a place that, god forbid, sells alcohol.\n\n**current issues with my mom:** my mother is a very naturally anxious person. i understand completely that my past actions triggered some of this and that she has a right to be put at ease, but i also feel like my behavior and actions over the past 3 years should elicit more trust. i always call my mother and i always let her know whats going on, who i'm with, what i'm doing. if i smoke weed, i tell my mom and let her know that i shouldn't be driving. she is fine with my weed use because it is not at all problematic (unless i have an edible or smoke a bit and don't want to drive, which is just an inconvenience that results in an unplanned sleepover at my best friend's house, which just annoys her because its unplanned). unplanned things throw her for a loop, even if there are no negative connotations. this is very rare, because usually when i do hang out with my best friend, i usually do plan ahead to sleepover because she lives an hour away. i really don't hang out with anyone consistently except for my best friend, and my parents love her, so it's not a huge issue. however, another issue with my mother is with my very reliable and safe car. she hates when i drive long distances, especially if it's at night. although i am not explicitly *not allowed* to go places and do things, i often turn down lots of fun activities and opportunities with people other than my best friend because i do not want to cause any anxiety for my mother. my best friend does not drink at all, so she is 'safe' in their minds. i feel very frustrated by this, because i am an adult. i know that i live at home and i need to be respectful of my parents, but it's hard for me on an internal and psychological level to hang out with other people because of the potential anxiety it could cause her. i spend tons of time at home and enjoy spending time with both my parents, but i can't help but feel extremely restricted and unable to breathe. another very frustrating situation is that my mother seems to think i am incapable of being around people who are drinking without going on a bender despite ample evidence that haven't gotten drunk and come home in several years or had any issues in relation to that. that deeply restricts what i (internally) feel like i can do with my peers, since many social get togethers or outings involve alcohol. my mother has made more headway in the trust department, but for me it is internalized apprehension at almost all times. the biggest thing is that i am her whole world. she loves me so much and loves to be around me, but i am her everything and she is constantly thinking about me and what i'm doing. she once called me from work because she knew i was driving to work, and she heard sirens driving by her work (located pretty close to mine) because she was afraid i got into an accident. to me, this is ridiculous. she has told me on several occasions that she compulsively prays for me whenever i am not home, no matter what context this is in. i mentioned before that i feel like i don't have sexual or romantic freedom and this is mainly because my mother watches way too much dateline and perceives every single one of my potential suitors as a serious threat. this is difficult because she is from a very different generation and doesn't understand that tinder and dating apps are the complete norm. i am VERY cautious with any man i go out with or date. i always take a picture of their license, their license plate, and continuously share my location with my best friend during any date i am on. i also live in the smallest state in the union, so pretty much every guy i match with, i know in some way or i know someone who knows them. i'm just frustrated.\n\ndoes anyone have any tips on how i can approach a conversation with my parents about the realities of dating and being more independent??\n\n**tl;dr** my parents are overbearing because of past mistakes i've made, and i don't know how to manage them, dating, and the reality that i am a fully grown women who has wants, needs, and desires that are not easily explained to my baby boomer parents. any tips to help me have a calm and rational discussion

serious bouts of anorexia, bulimia, and EDNOS (eating disorder not otherwise specified) that resulted in 3 hospitalizations to get my health on track. when i would drink, i would become a very angry person in regards to my parents, often fighting with them when i came home from whatever havoc i was wreaking. this resulted in screaming matches and trauma for both my parents and myself. this continued into my early twenties, especially during my very physically and emotionally abusive 3 year relationship. once i finally got out of that situation, i drastically cleaned up my act, refraining from excessive drinking or any other behavior that would result in negative effects. i still have a tricky relationship with food, but i haven&#39;t been at an unhealthy weight in 4 years. i am also a lot more mellow now, i make good decisions, i don&#39;t hang out with people that i could get into tricky predicaments with, i don&#39;t come home drunk, i don&#39;t do drugs (never did

So last year in January I was going through a break up and met a great guy who was going through one too. He was suffering A LOT harder than I was and was really depressed. Our relationship went from casually hooking up to me just being his shoulder to cry on and pushed him to move on.\n\n\nUntil May of 2019, we hung out a lot. It was routine for me to spend the night at his place, and we would just hang out until 3 am talking. We even stopped having sex after the second month because it felt weird. He introduced me to his church and took me on a spring vacation with his church members and he met my mother. Again, the sex has stopped.\n\n\nWhen summer came along he had to go back to his home country, and I told him when he gets back to bring me a small gift. We didn’t talk all summer, but when he came back he immediately contacts me and we meet up. He brings me gifts and said he was feeling amazing. He was ready to start over and focus on his grades since they were slipping due to his depression and his parents were threatening him.\n\n\nI mentioned I got back with my ex, but he seemed happy for me. We left happy. We hung out again 2 weeks later and he invited me to come hang out with his friend. I declined. I was then invited to go to church with him but had to cancel because of work.\n\n\nThe ghosting happened here: I asked him to see the joker movie with me in theaters. He canceled and I guess he felt bad and said we could go the next day. He cancels again saying he’s not feeling it, but we can go out for dinner instead that weekend but I couldn’t because of work again. He says we can whenever we are both ready.\n\n\nA few weeks later I asked how was school... He didn’t reply. So i waited a week and jokingly said “answer me!!” (This is my humor) He replies with exclamation marks asking how I was doing!!!? I joked and said “were you ignoring me?

It wasn’t like him at all. \n\n\nNow it is monthssss later and he never replied back. Never asked to hang out. Never asked how I was doing... I still think about it because I never got closure. I gave in and just texted again today sending a photo I took of him and joked about it, but nothing yet. What should I do now? Do I move on?

Apologies in advance for how verbose I imagine I’ll be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year now, just a month or two shy. I love him dearly and really value our relationship. He is the smartest person I know, endlessly gracious and patient, deliberately affectionate and considerate, so understanding and so compassionate. I adore his family, his friends, our shared community, and feel very much like I belong and am welcomed in his life. Our politics are meaningfully compatible and we not only share a faith, but are shockingly well-matched in our respective levels of piety. Our relationship has provided me with a love I didn’t know existed and has helped me learn so much about what I deserve/want/expect in a partner and where to look for it. I have been very happy, happier than I’ve ever felt in a romantic relationship before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe past six or so months, however, have come with some issues. He is unemployed and he is not in school. He was working over the summer when we began dating, and he has been enrolled in university before but has been on a sabbatical since before our relationship began. I was under the impression that new, steady employment and/or schooling were on his radar when we began our relationship and that I could expect to see one or both within a few months. It has, obviously, been several. He is brilliant and more than capable at accomplishing whatever he might like to pursue, and I know for certain his university is itching to have him back, and that the process would be much simpler and quicker than he imagines. It is frustrating to me to know how much is within his reach, much more than I’ve ever had access to, and to watch him refuse to claim it, to feel unworthy of it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know he struggles with anxiety and major depressive. I do, too, and have been in his position before, finding myself unable to just get out of my head and get my shit together, even when my relationship depends on it, even when my own quality of life depends on it. I have tried to keep this in mind when approaching him about it, to remain calm and compassionate in spite of how much difficulty I’m having with it. I know he’s no happier with the situation than I am, but, I have to be honest about how this is impacting my life and take that seriously, and it doesn’t look good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor starters, six months is a long time to have nothing going on. Again, I get it, I really do, especially considering that when I first moved to this city (where he lives), it took me three months to find work of my own. I am making up for it now by doing some difficult but high-paying shift work, and was able to remain fairly comfortable in the interim because of my savings and my planning for the worst. Six months is made much longer, too, considering that it makes up half of our relationship, and that fact and its connotations are certainly not lost on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, it is starting to really affect how I feel about him. I am obviously frustrated with him, but I am, more specifically, starting to lose my attraction to him. While our sex life was incredible during the beginning of our relationship, we now go weeks if not months without sleeping together. I cannot find it in myself to get in the mood while he does so little but sit around all day. His hygiene has been suffering, too, which doesn’t surprise me given his current state of mind, but I believe it is equally understandable that I do not want to have sex with a partner who has not showered in weeks, whose clothing is falling apart, who takes no pride in his appearance. His libido has remained the same in spite of all this and I just can’t match it, nor do I want to when I don’t feel he's paying himself and his body the respect he deserves. I am honestly kind of grossed out a lot of the time. I desperately don’t want him to feel like I don’t love him or am not attracted to him anymore, and, while I am bathed and well-groomed, it is well within my rights to expect the most basic level of adult human cleanliness from whomever wants me to sleep with them. I hate to admit it, but it is also sometimes difficult to feel even warmly, much less \\~\\~sexy\\~\\~ towards him when I know I've been busting my ass all week and he's been doing... nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt’s becoming more and more difficult for us to relate to one another, too. He seems shocked that I’m as tired as I am after work, sometimes even offended that I need the quiet and solitude that I do after working hard all day. Work is going well, too, so I’ve been planning some travel for myself, spending a little money on a few nice things, taking good care of myself and finding pleasure in it, starting to feel excited about my next five years. While I am still able to relate to him and what he has (or doesn’t have) going on, he is losing his ability to relate to me. I would love to take him along with me in this feeling and this future, to eventually get married and have children as we both want, but the distance between us and our respective positions in life is gradually increasing and he doesn’t seem concerned about or even aware of it, which makes me so sad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly in this non-exhaustive post, perhaps my least-justified but most upsetting feeling here is that he just doesn’t respect me. I had told him at the end of last year, pretty gravely after many other discussions about this, that I would feel much happier and more secure in our relationship if he found a job or re-enrolled in school by the beginning of January. Clearly, he did not. After so much discussion about this (and yes, we’ve done a lot of talking), he knows how I feel and how our relationship is affecting my life. I wonder if he doesn’t believe me because I don’t lose my shit on him about it, don’t nag him, don’t yell or cry or hand out ultimatums. I have never had any luck in previous relationships trying to exert control like that and it’s certainly not kind to whoever’s on the receiving end so I’ve abandoned any hint of that attitude completely. However, I am open and emotionally-expressive, careful with my words and intent on being understood, so I can’t imagine throwing a fit could make him understand anything any better than he already does. Although I know how stuck he feels, it is difficult for me to not feel that he just doesn’t care about my boundaries, limits, and expectations when he is doing literally nothing, however small, differently.

Apologies in advance for how verbose I imagine I’ll be.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year now, just a month or two shy. I love him dearly and really value our relationship. He is the smartest person I know, endlessly gracious and patient, deliberately affectionate and considerate, so understanding and so compassionate. I adore his family, his friends, our shared community, and feel very much like I belong and am welcomed in his life. Our politics are meaningfully compatible and we not only share a faith, but are shockingly well-matched in our respective levels of piety. Our relationship has provided me with a love I didn’t know existed and has helped me learn so much about what I deserve/want/expect in a partner and where to look for it. I have been very happy, happier than I’ve ever felt in a romantic relationship before.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The past six or so months, however, have come with some issues. He is unemployed and he is not in school. He was working over the summer when we began dating, and he has been enrolled in university before but has been on a sabbatical since before our relationship began. I was under the impression that new, steady employment and/or schooling were on his radar when we began our relationship and that I could expect to see one or both within a few months. It has, obviously, been several. He is brilliant and more than capable at accomplishing whatever he might like to pursue, and I know for certain his university is itching to have him back, and that the process would be much simpler and quicker than he imagines. It is frustrating to me to know how much is within his reach, much more than I’ve ever had access to, and to watch him refuse to claim it, to feel unworthy of it. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I know he struggles with anxiety and major depressive. I do, too, and have been in his position before, finding myself unable to just get out of my head and get my shit together, even when my relationship depends on it, even when my own quality of life depends on it. I have tried to keep this in mind when approaching him about it, to remain calm and compassionate in spite of how much difficulty I’m having with it. I know he’s no happier with the situation than I am, but, I have to be honest about how this is impacting my life and take that seriously, and it doesn’t look good.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>For starters, six months is a long time to have nothing going on. Again, I get it, I really do, especially considering that when I first moved to this city (where he lives), it took me three months to find work of my own. I am making up for it now by doing some difficult but high-paying shift work, and was able to remain fairly comfortable in the interim because of my savings and my planning for the worst. Six months is made much longer, too, considering that it makes up half of our relationship, and that fact and its connotations are certainly not lost on me.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, it is starting to really affect how I feel about him. I am obviously frustrated with him, but I am, more specifically, starting to lose my attraction to him. While our sex life was incredible during the beginning of our relationship, we now go weeks if not months without sleeping together. I cannot find it in myself to get in the mood while he does so little but sit around all day. His hygiene has been suffering, too, which doesn’t surprise me given his current state of mind, but I believe it is equally understandable that I do not want to have sex with a partner who has not showered in weeks, whose clothing is falling apart, who takes no pride in his appearance. His libido has remained the same in spite of all this and I just can’t match it, nor do I want to when I don’t feel he&#39;s paying himself and his body the respect he deserves. I am honestly kind of grossed out a lot of the time. I desperately don’t want him to feel like I don’t love him or am not attracted to him anymore, and, while I am bathed and well-groomed, it is well within my rights to expect the most basic level of adult human cleanliness from whomever wants me to sleep with them. I hate to admit it, but it is also sometimes difficult to feel even warmly, much less ~~sexy~~ towards him when I know I&#39;ve been busting my ass all week and he&#39;s been doing... nothing.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>It’s becoming more and more difficult for us to relate to one another, too. He seems shocked that I’m as tired as I am after work, sometimes even offended that I need the quiet and solitude that I do after working hard all day. Work is going well, too, so I’ve been planning some travel for myself, spending a little money on a few nice things, taking good care of myself and finding pleasure in it, starting to feel excited about my next five years. While I am still able to relate to him and what he has (or doesn’t have) going on, he is losing his ability to relate to me. I would love to take him along with me in this feeling and this future, to eventually get married and have children as we both want, but the distance between us and our respective positions in life is gradually increasing and he doesn’t seem concerned about or even aware of it, which makes me so sad.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Lastly in this non-exhaustive post, perhaps my least-justified but most upsetting feeling here is that he just doesn’t respect me. I had told him at the end of last year, pretty gravely after many other discussions about this, that I would feel much happier and more secure in our relationship if he found a job or re-enrolled in school by the beginning of January. Clearly, he did not. After so much discussion about this (and yes, we’ve done a lot of talking), he knows how I feel and how our relationship is affecting my life. I wonder if he doesn’t believe me because I don’t lose my shit on him about it, don’t nag him, don’t yell or cry or hand out ultimatums. I have never had any luck in previous relationships trying to exert control like that and it’s certainly not kind to whoever’s on the receiving end so I’ve abandoned any hint of that attitude completely. However, I am open and emotionally-expressive, careful with my words and intent on being understood, so I can’t imagine throwing a fit could make him understand anything any better than he already does. Although I know how stuck he feels, it is difficult for me to not feel that he just doesn’t care about my boundaries, limits, and expectations when he is doing literally nothing, however small, differently. Especially when his only contribution in these discussions is “I’ll get it done” followed by precisely zero behavioral changes. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I know the drill. I’m going to be out of here in three or four months, tops, if we stay on this path. It’ll break my heart to lose him, his parents, our church, all the beautiful pieces of our relationship, all the happiness he’s given me.

She is an au pair from Brasil and is incredibly beautiful, I’m from the US and we live in Georgia. We have an incredible relationship. We talk for hours and hours about stupid stuff/life/goals/hobbies/food etc....We can hang out and not talk and feel 100% comfortable. We have very similar goals for life so far; kids in 5-10 years, travel the world (we’ve been to Florida, North Carolina for skiing, and we’re in the Dominican Republic right now). \n\nAt least once a week I hear her say she is fat and needs to lose weight. She’s 5’4” and just stunning. If she lost 5-10lbs she would fit into that society norm of “perfect”. I freaking love the way she looks and don’t want to her to lose/gain weight or do anything. Mostly I just don’t want her to feel bad. I love the way she is. She has PCOS, a condition that makes it a little harder to lose weight. She’s very open about this stuff. \n\nSo, when she brings up that she is fat, or looks at another girl and says “wow, I wish I had her butt/body/abs”, what should I be responding with? Nothing? “No you don’t”. You’re skinny. You don’t need to lose weight? Right now I’m taking the approach of saying “you are perfect and don’t need to lose weight. I love the way you look”. Sometimes I’ll say something along the lines “her but isn’t as good as yours, you look like you workout and she doesn’t”. She responds with “now I know you’re lying” (she’s not mad, nor has a grin or anything. I honestly can’t read how she feels when I say this). \n\nObviously I don’t care what she looks like. She’s independent, smart, relaxed, competitive, driven, just amazing. But I don’t have the words, nor am tactful to transition the conversation to that. I’m fairly capable of keeping the conversation about how I care about her, and trying to phase appearance out of the conversation.

She is an au pair from Brasil and is incredibly beautiful, I’m from the US and we live in Georgia. We have an incredible relationship. We talk for hours and hours about stupid stuff/life/goals/hobbies/food etc....We can hang out and not talk and feel 100% comfortable. We have very similar goals for life so far; kids in 5-10 years, travel the world (we’ve been to Florida, North Carolina for skiing, and we’re in the Dominican Republic right now). </p>\n\n<p>At least once a week I hear her say she is fat and needs to lose weight. She’s 5’4” and just stunning. If she lost 5-10lbs she would fit into that society norm of “perfect”. I freaking love the way she looks and don’t want to her to lose/gain weight or do anything. Mostly I just don’t want her to feel bad. I love the way she is. She has PCOS, a condition that makes it a little harder to lose weight. She’s very open about this stuff. </p>\n\n<p>So, when she brings up that she is fat, or looks at another girl and says “wow, I wish I had her butt/body/abs”, what should I be responding with? Nothing? “No you don’t”. You’re skinny. You don’t need to lose weight? Right now I’m taking the approach of saying “you are perfect and don’t need to lose weight. I love the way you look”. Sometimes I’ll say something along the lines “her but isn’t as good as yours, you look like you workout and she doesn’t”. She responds with “now I know you’re lying” (she’s not mad, nor has a grin or anything. I honestly can’t read how she feels when I say this). </p>\n\n<p>Obviously I don’t care what she looks like. She’s independent, smart, relaxed, competitive, driven, just amazing. But I don’t have the words, nor am tactful to transition the conversation to that. I’m fairly capable of keeping the conversation about how I care about her, and trying to phase appearance out of the conversation. I try and access her love languages (she told me touch and words of affirmation). </p>\n\n<p>Help!!!! Any thoughts? Tips?
